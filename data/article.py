For years, I saw a client who lived by himself.* He was isolated in many
other ways in addition to his living situation. He had extremely limited
family ties. Both of his daughters had moved out of the country, and did not
maintain much contact, and he had no other relatives except a father and
sister from whom he was estranged. His wife and the mother of his children
had passed away years ago, and the sole relationship he endeavored to
establish while he saw me over the course of more than a decade and a half
terminated tragically when his new partner was killed in an automobile
accident.
When we began to work together, our conversations were decidedly
awkward. He was not accustomed to the subtleties of social interaction, so
his behaviors, verbal and nonverbal, lacked the dance-like rhythm and
harmony that characterize the socially fluent. As a child, he had been
thoroughly ignored as well as actively discouraged by both parents. His
father—mostly absent—was neglectful and sadistic in his inclinations,
while his mother was chronically alcoholic. He had also been consistently
tormented and harassed at school, and had not chanced upon a teacher in all
his years of education who paid him any genuine attention. These
experiences left my client with a proclivity toward depression, or at least
worsened what might have been a biological tendency in that direction. He
was, in consequence, abrupt, irritable, and somewhat volatile if he felt
misunderstood or was unexpectedly interrupted during a conversation. Such
reactions helped ensure that his targeting by bullies continued into his adult
life, particularly in his place of work.
I soon noticed, however, that things worked out quite well during our
sessions if I kept mostly quiet. He would drop in, weekly or biweekly, and
talk about what had befallen and preoccupied him during the previous seven
to fourteen days. If I maintained silence for the first fifty minutes of our
one-hour sessions, listening intently, then we could converse, in a relatively
normal, reciprocal manner, for the remaining ten minutes. This pattern
continued for more than a decade, as I learned, increasingly, to hold my
tongue (something that does not come easily to me). As the years passed,
however, I noticed that the proportion of time he spent discussing negative
issues with me decreased. Our conversation—his monologue, really—had
always started with what was bothering him, and rarely progressed past
that. But he worked hard outside our sessions, cultivating friends, attending
artistic gatherings and music festivals, and resurrecting a long-dormant
talent for composing songs and playing the guitar. As he became more
social, he began to generate solutions to the problems he communicated to
me, and to discuss, in the latter portion of the hours we shared, some of the
more positive aspects of his existence. It was slow going, but he made
continual incremental progress. When he first came to see me, we could not
sit together at a table in a coffee shop—or, indeed, in any public space—and
practice anything resembling a real-world conversation without his being
paralyzed into absolute silence. By the time we finished, he was reading his
original poetry in front of small groups, and had even tried his hand at
stand-up comedy.
He was the best personal and practical exemplar of something I had
come to realize over my more than twenty years of psychological practice:
people depend on constant communication with others to keep their minds
organized. We all need to think to keep things straight, but we mostly think
by talking. We need to talk about the past, so we can distinguish the trivial,
overblown concerns that otherwise plague our thoughts from the
experiences that are truly important. We need to talk about the nature of the
present and our plans for the future, so we know where we are, where we
are going, and why we are going there. We must submit the strategies and
tactics we formulate to the judgments of others, to ensure their efficiency
and resilience. We need to listen to ourselves as we talk, as well, so that we
may organize our otherwise inchoate bodily reactions, motivations, and
emotions into something articulate and organized, and dispense with those
concerns that are exaggerated and irrational. We need to talk—both to
remember and to forget.
My client desperately needed someone to listen to him. He also needed
to be fully part of additional, larger, and more complex social groups—
something he planned in our sessions together, and then carried out on his
own. Had he fallen prey to the temptation to denigrate the value of
interpersonal interactions and relationships because of his history of
isolation and harsh treatment, he would have had very little chance of
regaining his health and well-being. Instead, he learned the ropes and joined
the world.

For Drs. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the great depth psychologists,
sanity was a characteristic of the individual mind. People were welladjusted, in their views, when the subpersonalities existing within each of
them were properly integrated and balanced in expression. The id, the
instinctive part of the psyche (from the German “it,” representing nature, in
all its power and foreignness, inside us); the superego (the sometimes
oppressive, internalized representative of social order); and the ego (the I,
the personality proper, crushed between those two necessary tyrants)—all
had their specialized functions for Freud, who first conceptualized their
existence. Id, ego, and superego interacted with each other like the
executive, legislative, and judicial branches of a modern government. Jung,
although profoundly influenced by Freud, parsed the complexity of the
psyche in a different manner. For him, the ego of the individual had to find
its proper place in relationship to the shadow (the dark side of the
personality), the anima or animus (the contrasexual and thus often repressed
side of the personality), and the self (the internal being of ideal possibility).
But all these different subentities, Jungian and Freudian alike, share one
thing in common: they exist in the interior of the person, regardless of his or
her surroundings. People are social beings, however—par excellence—and
there is no shortage of wisdom and guidance outside of us, embedded in the
social world. Why rely on our own limited resources to remember the road,
or to orient ourselves in new territory, when we can rely on signs and
guideposts placed there so effortfully by others? Freud and Jung, with their
intense focus on the autonomous individual psyche, placed too little focus
on the role of the community in the maintenance of personal mental health.
It is for such reasons that I assess the position of all my new clinical
clients along a few dimensions largely dependent on the social world when
I first start working with them: Have they been educated to the level of their
intellectual ability or ambition? Is their use of free time engaging,
meaningful, and productive? Have they formulated solid and wellarticulated plans for the future? Are they (and those they are close to) free
of any serious physical health or economic problems? Do they have friends
and a social life? A stable and satisfying intimate partnership? Close and
functional familial relationships? A career—or, at least, a job—that is
financially sufficient, stable and, if possible, a source of satisfaction and
opportunity? If the answer to any three or more of these questions is no, I
consider that my new client is insufficiently embedded in the interpersonal
world and is in danger of spiraling downward psychologically because of
that. People exist among other people and not as purely individual minds.
An individual does not have to be that well put together if he or she can
remain at least minimally acceptable in behavior to others. Simply put: We
outsource the problem of sanity. People remain mentally healthy not merely
because of the integrity of their own minds, but because they are constantly
being reminded how to think, act, and speak by those around them.
If you begin to deviate from the straight and narrow path—if you begin
to act improperly—people will react to your errors before they become too
great, and cajole, laugh, tap, and criticize you back into place. They will
raise an eyebrow, or smile (or not), or pay attention (or not). If other people
can tolerate having you around, in other words, they will constantly remind
you not to misbehave, and just as constantly call on you to be at your best.
All that is left for you to do is watch, listen, and respond appropriately to
the cues. Then you might remain motivated, and able to stay together
enough so that you will not begin the long journey downhill. This is reason
enough to appreciate your immersion in the world of other people—friends,
family members, and foes alike—despite the anxiety and frustration that
social interactions so often produce.
But how did we develop the broad consensus regarding social behavior
that serves to buttress our psychological stability? It seems a daunting task
—if not impossible—in the face of the complexity that constantly confronts
us. “Do we pursue this or that?” “How does the worth of this piece of work
compare to the worth of that?” “Who is more competent, or more creative,
or more assertive, and should therefore be ceded authority?” Answers to
such questions are largely formulated in consequence of intensive
negotiation—verbal and nonverbal—regulating individual action,
cooperation, and competition. What we deem to be valuable and worthy of
attention becomes part of the social contract; part of the rewards and
punishments meted out respectively for compliance and noncompliance;
part of what continually indicates and reminds: “Here is what is valued.
Look at that (perceive that) and not something else. Pursue that (act toward
that end) and not some other.” Compliance with those indications and
reminders is, in large measure, sanity itself—and is something required
from every one of us right from the early stages of our lives. Without the
intermediation of the social world, it would be impossible for us to organize
our minds, and we would simply be overwhelmed by the world.

I have the great good fortune of a granddaughter, Elizabeth Scarlett
Peterson Korikova, born in August 2017. I have watched her carefully
while she develops, trying to understand what she is up to and playing
along with it. When she was about a year and a half old, she engaged in all
manner of unbearably endearing behaviors—giggling and laughing when
she was poked, high-fiving, bumping heads, and rubbing noses. However,
in my opinion, the most noteworthy of all the actions she undertook at that
age was her pointing.
She had discovered her index finger, using it to specify all the objects in
the world she found interesting. She delighted in doing so, particularly
when her pointing called forth the attention of the adults surrounding her.
This indicated, in a manner not duplicable in any other way, that her action
and intention had import—definable at least in part as the tendency of a
behavior or attitude to compel the attention of others. She thrived on that,
and no wonder. We compete for attention, personally, socially, and
economically. No currency has a value that exceeds it. Children, adults, and
societies wither on the vine in its absence. To have others attend to what
you find important or interesting is to validate, first, the importance of what
you are attending to, but second, and more crucially, to validate you as a
respected center of conscious experience and contributor to the collective
world. Pointing is, as well, a crucial precursor to the development of
language. To name something—to use the word for the thing—is essentially
to point to it, to specify it against everything else, to isolate it for use
individually and socially.
When my granddaughter pointed, she did it publicly. When she pointed
to something, she could immediately observe how the people close to her
reacted. There is just not that much point, so to speak, in pointing to
something that no one else cares about. So, she aimed her index finger at
something she found interesting and then looked around to see if anyone
else cared. She was learning an important lesson at an early age: If you are
not communicating about anything that engages other people, then the value
of your communication—even the value of your very presence—risks
falling to zero. It was in this manner that she began to more profoundly
explore the complex hierarchy of value that made up her family and the
broader society surrounding her.
Scarlett is now learning to talk—a more sophisticated form of pointing
(and of exploration). Every word is a pointer, as well as a simplification or
generalization. To name something is not only to make it shine forth against
the infinite background of potentially nameable things, but to group or
categorize it, simultaneously, with many other phenomena of its broad
utility or significance. We use the word “floor,” for example, but do not
generally employ a separate word for all the floors we might encounter
(concrete, wood, earth, glass), much less all the endless variations of color
and texture and shade that make up the details of the floors that bear our
weight. We use a low-resolution representation: If it holds us up, we can
walk on it, and is situated inside a building, then it is a “floor,” and that is
precise enough. The word distinguishes floors, say, from walls, but also
restricts the variability in all the floors that exist to a single concept—flat,
stable, walkable indoor surfaces.
The words we employ are tools that structure our experience,
subjectively and privately—but are, equally, socially determined. We would
not all know and use the word “floor” unless we had all agreed that there
was something sufficiently important about floors to justify a word for
them. So, the mere fact of naming something (and, of course, agreeing on
the name) is an important part of the process whereby the infinitely
complex world of phenomena and fact is reduced to the functional world of
value. And it is continual interaction with social institutions that makes this
reduction—this specification—possible.

The social world narrows and specifies the world for us, marking out what
is important. But what does “important” mean? How is it determined? The
individual is molded by the social world. But social institutions are molded,
too, by the requirements of the individuals who compose them.
Arrangements must be made for our provisioning with the basic
requirements of life. We cannot live without food, water, clean air, and
shelter. Less self-evidently, we require companionship, play, touch, and
intimacy. These are all biological as well as psychological necessities (and
this is by no means a comprehensive list). We must signify and then utilize
those elements of the world capable of providing us with these
requirements. And the fact that we are deeply social adds another set of
constraints to the situation: We must perceive and act in a manner that
meets our biological and psychological needs—but, since none of us lives
or can live in isolation, we must meet them in a manner approved of by
others. This means that the solutions we apply to our fundamental
biological problems must also be acceptable and implementable socially.
It is worth considering more deeply just how necessity limits the
universe of viable solutions and implementable plans. First, as we alluded
to, the plan must in principle solve some real problem. Second, it must
appeal to others—often in the face of competing plans—or those others will
not cooperate and might well object. If I value something, therefore, I must
determine how to value it so that others potentially benefit. It cannot just be
good for me: it must be good for me and for the people around me. And
even that is not good enough—which means there are even more constraints
on how the world must be perceived and acted upon. The manner in which I
view and value the world, integrally associated with the plans I am making,
has to work for me, my family, and the broader community. Furthermore, it
needs to work today, in a manner that does not make a worse hash of
tomorrow, next week, next month, and next year (even the next decade or
century). A good solution to a problem involving suffering must be
repeatable, without deterioration across repetitions—iterable, in a word—
across people and across time.
These universal constraints, manifest biologically and imposed socially,
reduce the complexity of the world to something approximating a
universally understandable domain of value. That is exceptionally
important, because there are unlimited problems and there are
hypothetically unlimited potential solutions, but there are a comparatively
limited number of solutions that work practically, psychologically, and
socially simultaneously. The fact of limited solutions implies the existence
of something like a natural ethic—variable, perhaps, as human languages
are variable, but still characterized by something solid and universally
recognizable at its base. It is the reality of this natural ethic that makes
thoughtless denigration of social institutions both wrong and dangerous:
wrong and dangerous because those institutions have evolved to solve
problems that must be solved for life to continue. They are by no means
perfect—but making them better, rather than worse, is a tricky problem
indeed.
So, I must take the complexity of the world, reduce it to a single point so
that I can act, and take everyone else and their future selves into
consideration while I am doing so. How do I manage this? By
communicating and negotiating. By outsourcing the terribly complex
cognitive problem to the resources of the broader world. The individuals
who compose every society cooperate and compete linguistically (although
linguistic interaction by no means exhausts the means of cooperation and
competition). Words are formulated collectively, and everyone must agree
on their use. The verbal framework that helps us delimit the world is a
consequence of the landscape of value that is constructed socially—but also
bounded by the brute necessity of reality itself. This helps give that
landscape shape, and not just any old shape. This is where hierarchies—
functional, productive hierarchies—more clearly enter the picture.
Things of import must be done, or people starve or die of thirst or
exposure—or of loneliness and absence of touch. What needs to be done
must be specified and planned. The requisite skills for doing so must be
developed. That specification, planning, and development of skills, as well
as the implementation of the informed plan, must be conducted in social
space, with the cooperation of others (and in the face of their competition).
In consequence, some will be better at solving the problem at hand, and
others worse. This variance in ability (as well as the multiplicity of extant
problems and the impossibility of training everyone in all skilled domains)
necessarily engenders a hierarchical structure—based ideally on genuine
competence in relation to the goal. Such a hierarchy is in its essence a
socially structured tool that must be employed for the effective
accomplishment of necessary and worthwhile tasks. It is also a social
institution that makes progress and peace possible at the same time.

The consensus making up the spoken and unspoken assumptions of worth
characterizing our societies has an ancient origin, developing over the
course of hundreds of millions of years. After all, “How should you act?” is
just the short-term, immediate version of the fundamental long-term
question, “How should you survive?” It is therefore instructive to look into
the distant past—far down the evolutionary chain, right to the basics—and
contemplate the establishment of what is important. The most
phylogenetically ancient multicellular organisms (that is far enough for our
purposes) tend to be composed of relatively undifferentiated sensorimotor
cells.1
 These cells map certain facts or features of the environment directly
onto the motor output of the same cells, in an essentially one-to-one
relationship. Stimulus A means response A, and nothing else, while
stimulus B means response B. Among more differentiated and complex
creatures—the larger and commonly recognizable denizens of the natural
world—the sensory and motor functions separate and specialize, such that
cells undertaking the former functions detect patterns in the world and cells
in the latter produce patterns of motor output. This differentiation enables a
broader range of patterns to be recognized and mapped, as well as a broader
range of action and reaction to be undertaken. A third type of cell—neural
—emerges sometimes, as well, serving as a computational intermediary
between the first two. Among species that have established a neural level of
operation, the “same” pattern of input can produce a different pattern of
output (depending, for example, on changes in the animal’s environment or
internal psychophysical condition).
As nervous systems increase in sophistication, and more and more layers
of neural intermediation emerge, the relationship between simple fact and
motor output becomes increasingly complex, unpredictable, and
sophisticated. What is putatively the same thing or situation can be
perceived in multiple ways, and two things perceived in the same manner
can still give rise to very different behaviors. It is very difficult to constrain
even isolated laboratory animals, for example, so thoroughly that they will
behave predictably across trials that have been made as similar as possible.
As the layers of neural tissue mediating between sensation and action
multiply, they also differentiate. Basic motivational systems, often known
as drives, appear (hunger, thirst, aggression, etc.), adding additional sensory
and behavioral specificity and variability. Superseding motivations, in turn
—with no clear line of demarcation—are systems of emotion. Cognitive
systems emerge much later, first taking form, arguably, as imagination, and
later—and only among human beings—as full-fledged language. Thus, in
the most complex of creatures, there is an internal hierarchy of structure,
from reflex through drive to language-mediated action (in the particular
case of human beings), that must be organized before it can function as a
unity and be aimed at a point.2
How is this hierarchy organized—a structure that emerged in large part
from the bottom up, over the vast spans of evolutionary time? We return to
the same answer alluded to earlier: through the constant cooperation and
competition—the constant jockeying for resources and position—defining
the struggle for survival and reproduction. This happens over the
unimaginably lengthy spans of time that characterize evolution, as well as
the much shorter course of each individual life. Negotiation for position
sorts organisms into the omnipresent hierarchies that govern access to vital
resources such as shelter, nourishment, and mates. All creatures of
reasonable complexity and even a minimally social nature have their
particular place, and know it. All social creatures also learn what is deemed
valuable by other group members, and derive from that, as well as from the
understanding of their own position, a sophisticated implicit and explicit
understanding of value itself. In a phrase: The internal hierarchy that
translates facts into actions mirrors the external hierarchy of social
organization. It is clear, for example, that chimpanzees in a troop
understand their social world and its hierarchical strata at a fine level of
detail. They know what is important, and who has privileged access to it.
They understand such things as if their survival and reproduction depend
upon it, as it does.3
A newborn infant is equipped with relatively deterministic reflexes:
sucking, crying, startling. These nonetheless provide the starting point for
the immense range of skills in action that develop with human maturation.
By the age of two (and often much earlier than that, for many skills),
children can orient with all their senses, walk upright, use their opposablethumb-equipped hands for all sorts of purposes, and communicate their
desires and needs both nonverbally and verbally—and this is of course a
partial list. This immense array of behavioral abilities is integrated into a
complex assortment of emotions and motivational drives (anger, sadness,
fear, joy, surprise, and more) and then organized to fulfill whatever specific,
narrow purpose inspires the child for the moment and, increasingly, over
longer spans of time.
The developing infant must also hone and perfect the operation of his or
her currently dominant motivational state in harmony with all his or her
other internal motivational states (as, for example, the separate desire to eat,
sleep, and play must learn to coexist so each can manifest itself optimally),
and in keeping with the demands, routines, and opportunities of the social
environment. This honing and perfecting begin within the child’s maternal
relationship and the spontaneous play behavior within that circumscribed
but still social context. Then, when the child has matured to the point where
the internal hierarchy of emotional and motivational functions can be
subsumed, even temporarily, within a framework provided by a conscious,
communicable abstract goal (“let us play house”), the child is ready to play
with others—and to do so, over time, in an increasingly complex and
sophisticated manner.
Play with others depends (as the great developmental psychologist Jean
Piaget observed) upon the collective establishment of a shared goal with
the child’s play partners. The collective establishment of a shared goal—the
point of the game—conjoined with rules governing cooperation and
competition in relationship to that goal or point, constitutes a true social
microcosm. All societies might be regarded as variations upon this
play/game theme—E pluribus unum*—and in all functional and decent
societies the basic rules of fair play, predicated upon reciprocity across
situation and time, come inevitably to apply. Games, like solutions to
problems, must be iterable to endure, and there are principles that apply to
and undergird what constitutes that iterability. Piaget suspected, for
example, that games undertaken voluntarily will outcompete games
imposed and played under threat of force, given that some of the energy that
could be expended on the game itself, whatever its nature, has to be wasted
on enforcement. There is evidence indicating the emergence of such
voluntary game-like arrangements even among our nonhuman kin.6
The universal rules of fair play include the ability to regulate emotion
and motivation while cooperating and competing in pursuit of the goal
during the game (that is part and parcel of being able to play at all), as well
as the ability and will to establish reciprocally beneficial interactions across
time and situation, as we already discussed. And life is not simply a game,
but a series of games, each of which has something in common (whatever
defines a game) and something unique (or there would be no reason for
multiple games). At minimum, there is a starting point (kindergarten, a 0–0
score, a first date, an entry-level job) that needs to be improved upon; a
procedure for enacting that improvement; and a desirable goal (graduation
from high school, a winning score, a permanent romantic relationship, a
prestigious career). Because of that commonality, there is an ethic—or more
properly, a meta-ethic—that emerges, from the bottom up, across the set of
all games. The best player is therefore not the winner of any given game
but, among many other things, he or she who is invited by the largest
number of others to play the most extensive series of games. It is for this
reason, which you may not understand explicitly at the time, that you tell
your children: “It’s not whether you win or lose. It’s how you play the
game!”* How should you play, to be that most desirable of players? What
structure must take form within you so that such play is possible? And those
two questions are interrelated, because the structure that will enable you to
play properly (and with increasing and automated or habitual precision) will
emerge only in the process of continually practicing the art of playing
properly. Where might you learn how to play? Everywhere . . . if you are
fortunate and awake.

It is useful to take your place at the bottom of a hierarchy. It can aid in the
development of gratitude and humility. Gratitude: There are people whose
expertise exceeds your own, and you should be wisely pleased about that.
There are many valuable niches to fill, given the many complex and serious
problems we must solve. The fact that there are people who fill those niches
with trustworthy skill and experience is something for which to be truly
thankful. Humility: It is better to presume ignorance and invite learning
than to assume sufficient knowledge and risk the consequent blindness. It is
much better to make friends with what you do not know than with what you
do know, as there is an infinite supply of the former but a finite stock of the
latter. When you are tightly boxed in or cornered—all too often by your
own stubborn and fixed adherence to some unconsciously worshipped
assumptions—all there is to help you is what you have not yet learned.
It is necessary and helpful to be, and in some ways to remain, a beginner.
For this reason, the Tarot deck beloved by intuitives, romantics, fortunetellers, and scoundrels alike contains within it the Fool as a positive card, an
illustrated variant of which opens this chapter. The Fool is a young,
handsome man, eyes lifted upward, journeying in the mountains, sun
shining brightly upon him—about to carelessly step over a cliff (or is he?).
His strength, however, is precisely his willingness to risk such a drop; to
risk being once again at the bottom. No one unwilling to be a foolish
beginner can learn. It was for this reason, among others, that Carl Jung
regarded the Fool as the archetypal precursor to the figure of the equally
archetypal Redeemer, the perfected individual.
The beginner, the fool, is continually required to be patient and tolerant
—with himself and, equally, with others. His displays of ignorance,
inexperience, and lack of skill may still sometimes be rightly attributed to
irresponsibility and condemned, justly, by others. But the insufficiency of
the fool is often better regarded as an inevitable consequence of each
individual’s essential vulnerability, rather than as a true moral failing. Much
that is great starts small, ignorant, and useless. This lesson permeates
popular as well as classical or traditional culture. Consider, for example, the
Disney heroes Pinocchio and Simba, as well as J. K. Rowling’s magical
Harry Potter. Pinocchio begins as a wooden-headed marionette, the puppet
of everyone’s decisions but his own. The Lion King has his origin as a
naive cub, the unwitting pawn of a treacherous and malevolent uncle. The
student of wizarding is an unloved orphan, with a dusty cupboard for a
bedroom, and Voldemort—who might as well be Satan himself—for his
archenemy. Great mythologized heroes often come into the world, likewise,
in the most meager of circumstances (as the child of an Israelite slave, for
example, or newborn in a lowly manger) and in great danger (consider the
Pharaoh’s decision to slay all the firstborn male babies of the Israelites, and
Herod’s comparable edict, much later). But today’s beginner is tomorrow’s
master. Thus, it is necessary even for the most accomplished (but who
wishes to accomplish still more) to retain identification with the as yet
unsuccessful; to appreciate the striving toward competence; to carefully and
with true humility subordinate him or herself to the current game; and to
develop the knowledge, self-control, and discipline necessary to make the
next move.
I visited a restaurant in Toronto with my wife, son, and daughter while
writing this. As I made my way to my party’s table, a young waiter asked if
he might say a few words to me. He told me that he had been watching my
videos, listening to my podcasts, and reading my book, and that he had, in
consequence, changed his attitude toward his comparatively lower-status
(but still useful and necessary) job. He had ceased criticizing what he was
doing or himself for doing it, deciding instead to be grateful and seek out
whatever opportunities presented themselves right there before him. He
made up his mind to become more diligent and reliable and to see what
would happen if he worked as hard at it as he could. He told me, with an
uncontrived smile, that he had been promoted three times in six months.
The young man had come to realize that every place he might find
himself in had more potential than he might first see (particularly when his
vision was impaired by the resentment and cynicism he felt from being near
the bottom). After all, it is not as if a restaurant is a simple place—and this
was part of an extensive national organization, a large, high-quality chain.
To do a good job in such a place, servers must get along with the cooks,
who are by universal recognition a formidably troublesome and tricky lot.
They must also be polite and engaging with customers. They have to pay
attention constantly. They must adjust to highly varying workloads—the
rushes and dead times that inevitably accompany the life of a server. They
have to show up on time, sober and awake. They must treat their superiors
with the proper respect and do the same for those—such as the dishwashers
—below them in the structure of authority. And if they do all these things,
and happen to be working in a functional institution, they will soon render
themselves difficult to replace. Customers, colleagues, and superiors alike
will begin to react to them in an increasingly positive manner. Doors that
would otherwise remain closed to them—even invisible—will be opened.
Furthermore, the skills they acquire will prove eminently portable, whether
they continue to rise in the hierarchy of restaurateurs, decide instead to
further their education, or change their career trajectory completely (in
which case they will leave with laudatory praise from their previous
employers and vastly increased chances of discovering the next
opportunity).
As might be expected, the young man who had something to say to me
was thrilled with what had happened to him. His status concerns had been
solidly and realistically addressed by his rapid career advance, and the
additional money he was making did not hurt, either. He had accepted, and
therefore transcended, his role as a beginner. He had ceased being casually
cynical about the place he occupied in the world and the people who
surrounded him, and accepted the structure and the position he was offered.
He started to see possibility and opportunity, where before he was blinded,
essentially, by his pride. He stopped denigrating the social institution he
found himself part of and began to play his part properly. And that
increment in humility paid off in spades.

It is good to be a beginner, but it is a good of a different sort to be an equal
among equals. It is said, with much truth, that genuine communication can
take place only between peers. This is because it is very difficult to move
information up a hierarchy. Those well positioned (and this is a great danger
of moving up) have used their current competence—their cherished
opinions, their present knowledge, their current skills—to stake a moral
claim to their status. In consequence, they have little motivation to admit to
error, to learn or change—and plenty of reason not to. If a subordinate
exposes the ignorance of someone with greater status, he risks humiliating
that person, questioning the validity of the latter’s claim to influence and
status, and revealing him as incompetent, outdated, or false. For this reason,
it is very wise to approach your boss, for example, carefully and privately
with a problem (and perhaps best to have a solution at hand—and not one
proffered too incautiously).
Barriers exist to the flow of genuine information down a hierarchy, as
well. For example, the resentment people lower in the chain of command
might feel about their hypothetically lesser position can make them loath to
act productively on information from above—or, in the worst case, can
motivate them to work at counterpurposes to what they have learned, out of
sheer spite. In addition, those who are inexperienced or less educated, or
who newly occupy a subordinate position and therefore lack knowledge of
their surroundings, can be more easily influenced by relative position and
the exercise of power, instead of quality of argumentation and observation
of competence. Peers, by contrast, must in the main be convinced. Their
attention must be carefully reciprocated. To be surrounded by peers is to
exist in a state of equality, and to manifest the give-and-take necessary to
maintain that equality. It is therefore good to be in the middle of a hierarchy.
This is partly why friendships are so important, and why they form so
early in life. A two-year-old, typically, is self-concerned, although also
capable of simple reciprocal actions. The same Scarlett whom I talked
about earlier—my granddaughter—would happily hand me one of her
favorite stuffed toys, attached to a pacifier, when I asked her to. Then I
would hand it, or toss it, back (sometimes she would toss it to me, too—or
at least relatively near me). She loved this game. We played it with a spoon,
as well—an implement she was just beginning to master. She played the
same way with her mother and her grandmother—with anyone who
happened to be within playing distance, if she was familiar enough with
them not to be shy. This was the beginning of the behaviors that transform
themselves into full-fledged sharing among older children.
My daughter, Mikhaila, Scarlett’s mother, took her child to the outdoor
recreational space on top of their downtown condo a few days before I
wrote this. A number of other children were playing there, most of them
older, and there were plenty of toys. Scarlett spent her time hoarding as
many of the playthings as possible near her mother’s chair, and was
distinctly unimpressed if other children came along to purloin one for
themselves. She even took a ball directly from another child to add to her
collection. This is typical behavior for children two and younger. Their
ability to reciprocate, while hardly absent (and able to manifest itself in
truly endearing ways), is developmentally limited.
By three years of age, however, most children are capable of truly
sharing. They can delay gratification long enough to take their turn while
playing a game that everyone cannot play simultaneously. They can begin
to understand the point of a game played by several people and follow the
rules, although they may not be able to give a coherent verbal account of
what those rules are. They start to form friendships upon repeated exposure
to children with whom they have successfully negotiated reciprocal play
relationships. Some of these friendships turn into the first intense
relationships that children have outside their family. It is in the context of
such relationships, which tend strongly to form between equals in age (or at
least equals in developmental stage), that a child learns to bond tightly to a
peer and starts to learn how to treat another person properly while requiring
the same in return.
This mutual bonding is vitally important. A child without at least one
special, close friend is much more likely to suffer later psychological
problems, whether of the depressive/anxious or antisocial sort, while
children with fewer friends are also more likely to be unemployed and
unmarried as adults.
 There is no evidence that the importance of friendship
declines in any manner with age.* All causes of mortality appear to be
reduced among adults with high-quality social networks, even when general
health status is taken into consideration. This remains true among the
elderly in the case of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, emphysema,
and arthritis, and for younger and older adults alike in the case of heart
attacks. Interestingly enough, there is some evidence that it is the provision
of social support, as much or more than its receipt, that provides these
protective benefits (and, somewhat unsurprisingly, that those who give
more tend to receive more). Thus, it truly seems that it is better to give than to receive.
Peers distribute both the burdens and joys of life. Recently, when my
wife, Tammy, and I suffered serious health problems, we were fortunate
enough to have family members (my in-laws, sister and brother; my own
mother and sister; our children) and close friends stay with us and help for
substantial periods of time. They were willing to put their own lives on hold
to aid us while we were in crisis. Before that, when my book 12 Rules for
Life became a success, and during the extensive speaking tour that
followed, Tammy and I were close to people with whom we could share our
good fortune. These were friends and family members genuinely pleased
with what was happening and following the events of our lives avidly, and
who were willing to discuss what could have been the overwhelming public
response. This greatly heightened the significance and meaning of
everything we were doing and reduced the isolation that such a dramatic
shift in life circumstances, for better or worse, is likely to produce.
The relationships established with colleagues of similar status at work
constitute another important source of peer regulation, in addition to
friendship. To maintain good relationships with your colleagues means,
among other things, to give credit where credit is due; to take your fair
share of the jobs no one wants but still must be done; to deliver on time and
in a high-quality manner when teamed with other people; to show up when
expected; and, in general, to be trusted to do somewhat more than your job
formally requires. The approval or disapproval of your colleagues rewards
and enforces this continual reciprocity, and that—like the reciprocity that is
necessarily part of friendship—helps maintain stable psychological
function. It is much better to be someone who can be relied upon, not least
so that during times of personal trouble the people you have worked beside
are willing and able to step in and help.

How, then, is the personality that balances respect for social institutions
and, equally, creative transformation to be understood? It is not so easy to
determine, given the complexity of the problem. For that reason, we turn to
stories. Stories provide us with a broad template. They outline a pattern
specific enough to be of tremendous value, if we can imitate it, but general
enough (unlike a particular rule or set of rules) to apply even to new
situations. In stories, we capture observations of the ideal personality. We
tell tales about success and failure in adventure and romance. Across our
narrative universes, success moves us forward to what is better, to the
promised land; failure dooms us, and those who become entangled with us,
to the abyss. The good moves us upward and ahead, and evil drags us
backward and down. Great stories are about characters in action, and so
they mirror the unconscious structures and processes that help us translate
the intransigent world of facts into the sustainable, functional, reciprocal
social world of values.*
The properly embodied hierarchy of values—including the value of
conservatism and its twin, creative transformation—finds its expression as a
personality, in narrative—an ideal personality. Every hierarchy has
something at its pinnacle. It is for this reason that a story, which is a
description of the action of a personality, has a hero (and even if that
someone is the antihero, it does not matter: the antihero serves the function
of identifying the hero through contrast, as the hero is what the antihero is
most decidedly not). The hero is the individual at the peak, the victor, the
champion, the wit, the eventually successful and deserving underdog, the
speaker of truth under perilous circumstances, and more. The stories we
create, watch, listen to, and remember center themselves on actions and
attitudes we find interesting, compelling, and worthy of communication as a
consequence of our personal experience with both admirable and detestable
people (or fragments of their specific attitudes and actions), or because of
our proclivity to share what has gripped our attention with those who
surround us. Sometimes we can draw compelling narratives directly from
our personal experience with individual people; sometimes we create
amalgams of multiple personalities, often in concert with those who
compose our social groups.
The client whose story was told in part earlier had a life usefully
employed as an example of the necessity of social engagement. That tale
did not, however, exhaust the significance of his transformed attitudes and
actions. While he was reconstructing his social life, becoming an active
participant in a range of collective activities, he simultaneously developed a
certain creative expertise that was equally unexpected. He had not benefited
from formal education beyond the high school level, and did not have a
personality that immediately struck the external observer as markedly
creative. However, the personally novel social pursuits that attracted him
were in the main oriented toward aesthetic endeavor.
He first developed his eye for form, symmetry, novelty, and beauty as a
photographer. The social advantages of this pursuit were manifold: he
joined a club that had its members attend biweekly photography walks,
where they would sojourn as a group of twenty or so to parts of the city that
were visually interesting, either for their natural beauty or uniqueness or for
the attraction they held as industrial landscapes. He learned a fair bit about
photographic equipment, technically, because of doing so. The group
members also critiqued one another’s work—and they did this
constructively, which meant that all of them appeared to indicate what
errors had been made but also what of value had been managed.
This all helped my client learn to communicate in a productive manner
about topics that might otherwise have been psychologically difficult
(touching as they did on criticisms that, because of their association with
creative vision, could easily have generated counterproductively sensitive
overreactions) and, as well, to increasingly distinguish between visual
images that were trite or dull or conformist and those of genuine quality.
After a few months, his perception had developed sufficiently so that he
began to win local contests and generate small professional commissions. I
had believed from the beginning that his participation in the photography
club was well advised from the perspective of personality development, but
I was genuinely struck by the rapid development of his visual and technical
ability and very much enjoyed the times we spent in our sessions reviewing
his work.
After a few months of work on the photography front, my client began to
produce and to show me other images he had created, as well—which were
in their first incarnation decidedly amateurish abstract line drawings done in
pen. These essentially consisted of loops of various sizes, joined
continuously, on a single page: scribbles, really, although more controlled
and evidently purposeful than mere scribbles. As I had with the
photographs (and the photography club), I regarded these as
psychologically useful—as an extension of creative ability—but not as
worthwhile artistic endeavors in their own right. He kept at it, however,
generating several drawings a week, all the while bringing what he had
created to our sessions. What he produced increased in sophistication and
beauty with dramatic rapidity. Soon, he was drawing complex, symmetrical,
and rather dramatic black-and-white pen-and-ink drawings of sufficient
intrinsic beauty to serve as commercially viable T-shirt designs.
I had seen this sort of development clearly in the case of two other
clients, both characterized by intrinsically creative temperaments (very well
hidden in one of the cases; more developed, nurtured, and obvious in the
other). In addition, I had read accounts of clinical cases and personal
development by Carl Jung, who noted that the production of increasingly
ordered and complex geometrical figures—often circles within squares, or
the reverse—regularly accompanied an increase in organization of the
personality. This certainly seemed true not only of my client, as evidenced
by his burgeoning expertise at photography and the development of his skill
as a graphic artist, but also of the two others I had the pleasure of serving as
a clinical therapist. What I observed repeatedly was, therefore, not only the
reconstruction of the psyche as a consequence of further socialization (and
the valuation of social institutions) but the parallel transformation of
primarily interior processes, indicated by a marked increase in the capacity
to perceive and to create what was elegant, beautiful, and socially valued.
My clients had learned not only to submit properly to the sometimes
arbitrary but still necessary demands of the social world, but to offer to that
world something it would not have had access to had it not been for their
private creative work.
My granddaughter, Scarlett, also came to exhibit behaviors that were
indicative of, if not her creative ability, then at least her appreciation for
creative ability, in addition to her socialization as an agent of socially
valued pointing. When people discuss a story—presented as a movie, or a
play, or a book—they commonly attempt to come to a sophisticated
consensus about its point (sophisticated because a group of people can
generally offer more viewpoints than a single individual; consensus because
the discussion usually continues until some broad agreement is reached as
to the topic at hand). Now, the idea that a story is a form of communication
—and entertainment—is one of those facts that appears self-evident upon
first consideration, but that becomes more mysterious the longer it is
pondered. If it is true that a story has a point, then it is clear that it is
pointing to something. But what, and how? What constitutes pointing is
obvious when it is an action specifying a particular thing, or a person by a
particular person, but much less obvious when it is something typifying the
cumulative behavior, shall we say, of a character in a story.
The actions and attitudes of J. K. Rowling’s heroes and heroines once
again provide popular examples of precisely this process. Harry Potter, Ron
Weasley, and Hermione Granger are typified in large part by the willingness
and ability to follow rules (indicating their expertise as apprentices) and,
simultaneously, to break them. While those who supervise them are
inclined, equally, to reward both apparently paradoxical forms of behavior.
Even the technologies used by the young wizards during their
apprenticeship are characterized by this duality. The Marauder’s Map, for
example (which provides its bearer with an accurate representation of
explored territory in the form of the physical layout or geography of
Hogwarts, the wizarding school, as well as the locale of all its living
denizens), can be activated as a functional tool only by uttering a set of
words that seem to indicate the very opposite of moral behavior: “I
solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” and deactivated, so that its
function remains secret, with the phrase “Mischief managed.”
It is no easy matter to understand how an artifact that requires such
statements to make it usable could possibly be anything but “no good”—a
tool of evil purpose, apparently. But, like the fact that Harry and his friends
regularly but carefully break rules, and are equally regularly and carefully
rewarded for doing so, the Marauder’s Map varies in its ethical desirability
with the intent of its users. There is a strong implication throughout the
series that what is good cannot be simply encapsulated by mindless or rigid
rule following, no matter how disciplined that following, or how vital the
rules so followed. What this all means is that the Harry Potter series does
not point to drone-like subservience to social order as the highest of moral
virtues. What supersedes that obedience is not so obvious that it can be
easily articulated, but it is something like “Follow rules except when doing
so undermines the purpose of those selfsame rules—in which case take the
risk of acting in a manner contrary to what has been agreed upon as moral.”
This is a lesson that seems more easily taught by representations of the
behaviors that embody it than transmitted by, say, rote learning or a variant
rule. Meta-rules (which might be regarded as rules about rules, rather than
rules themselves) are not necessarily communicated in the same manner as
simple rules themselves.
Scarlett, with her emphasis on pointing, learned soon after mastering the
comparatively straightforward physical act, to grasp the more complex
point of narratives. She could signify something with her index finger at the
age of a year and a half. By two and a half years, however, she could
understand and imitate the far more intricate point of a story. For a period of
approximately six months, at the latter age, she would insist, when asked,
that she was Pocahontas, rather than Ellie (the name preferred by her father)
or Scarlett (preferred by her mother). This was a staggering act of
sophisticated thought, as far as I was concerned. She had been given a
Pocahontas doll, which became one of her favorite toys, along with a baby
doll (also very well loved), who she named after her grandmother, my wife,
Tammy. When she played with the infant doll, Ellie was the mother. With
Pocahontas, however, the situation differed. That doll was not a baby, and
Ellie was not its mother. My granddaughter regarded herself, instead, as the
grown Pocahontas—mimicking the doll, which was fashioned like a young
woman, as well as the character who served as the lead in the Disney movie
of the same name, which she had raptly observed on two separate
occasions.
The Disney Pocahontas bore marked similarities to the main protagonists
of the Harry Potter series. She finds herself promised by her father to
Kocoum, a brave warrior who embodies, in all seriousness, the virtues of
his tribe, but whose behavior and attitudes are too rule bound for the more
expansive personality of his bride-to-be. Pocahontas falls in love, instead,
with John Smith, captain of a ship from Europe and representative of that
which falls outside of known territory but is (potentially) of great value.
Paradoxically, Pocahontas is pursuing a higher moral order in rejecting
Kocoum for Smith—breaking a profoundly important rule (value what is
most valued in the current culture’s hierarchy of rules)—very much in the
same manner as the primary Potter characters. That is the moral of both
narratives: follow the rules until you are capable of being a shining
exemplar of what they represent, but break them when those very rules now
constitute the most dire impediment to the embodiment of their central
virtues. And Elizabeth Scarlett, not yet three years of age, had the intrinsic
wisdom to see this as the point of what she was watching (the Disney
movie) and using as a role-playing aid (the doll Pocahontas). Her
perspicacity in this regard bordered on the unfathomable.
The same set of ideas—respect for the rules, except when following
those rules means disregarding or ignoring or remaining blind to an even
higher moral principle—is represented with stunning power in two different
Gospel narratives (which serve, regardless of your opinion about them, as
central traditional or classical stories portraying a personality for the
purposes of evoking imitation). In the first, Christ is presented, even as a
child, as a master of the Jewish tradition. This makes him fully informed as
to the value of the past, and portrays him as characterized by the respect
typical, say, of the genuine conservative.
A paradox emerges, however, as the entirety of the Gospel accounts are
considered—one closely associated with the tension between respect for
tradition and the necessity for creative transformation. Despite the evidence
of His thorough and even precocious understanding and appreciation of the
rules, the adult Christ repeatedly and scandalously violates the Sabbath
traditions—at least from the standpoint of the traditionalists in His
community, and much to His own peril. He leads His disciples through a
cornfield, for example, plucking and eating the grains (Luke 6:1). He
justifies this to the Pharisees who object by referring to an account of King
David acting in a similar manner, feeding his people when necessity
demanded it on bread that was reserved for the priests (Luke 6:4). Christ
tells his interlocutors quite remarkably “that the Son of man is Lord also of
the sabbath” (Luke 6:5).
An ancient document known as the Codex Bezae,* a noncanonical
variant of part of the New Testament, offers an interpolation just after the
section of the Gospel of Luke presented above, shedding profound light on
the same issue. It offers deeper insight into the complex and paradoxical
relationship between respect for the rules and creative moral action that is
necessary and desirable, despite manifesting itself in apparent opposition to
those rules. It contains an account of Christ addressing someone who, like
Him, has broken a sacred rule: “On that same day, observing one working
on the Sabbath, [Jesus] said to him O Man, if indeed thou knowest what
thou doest, thou art blest; but if thou knowest not, thou art accursed, and a
transgressor of the Law.”12
What does this statement mean? It sums up the meaning of Rule I
perfectly. If you understand the rules—their necessity, their sacredness, the
chaos they keep at bay, how they unite the communities that follow them,
the price paid for their establishment, and the danger of breaking them—but
you are willing to fully shoulder the responsibility of making an exception,
because you see that as serving a higher good (and if you are a person with
sufficient character to manage that distinction), then you have served the
spirit, rather than the mere law, and that is an elevated moral act. But if you
refuse to realize the importance of the rules you are violating and act out of
self-centered convenience, then you are appropriately and inevitably
damned. The carelessness you exhibit with regard to your own tradition will
undo you and perhaps those around you fully and painfully across time.
This is in keeping with other sentiments and acts of Christ described in
the Gospels. Matthew 12:11 states: “And he said unto them, What man
shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit
on the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?” Luke chapter
6 describes Him healing a man with a withered hand on another Sabbath,
stating “It is lawful on the Sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
life, or destroy it?” (Luke 6:9). This psychologically and conceptually
painful juxtaposition of two moral stances (the keeping of the Sabbath
versus the injunction to do good) is something else that constantly enrages
the Pharisees, and is part of the series of events that eventually leads to
Christ’s arrest and Crucifixion. These stories portray the existential
dilemma that eternally characterizes human life: it is necessary to conform,
to be disciplined, and to follow the rules—to do humbly what others do; but
it is also necessary to use judgment, vision, and the truth that guides
conscience to tell what is right, when the rules suggest otherwise. It is the
ability to manage this combination that truly characterizes the fully
developed personality: the true hero.
A certain amount of arbitrary rule-ness must be tolerated—or welcomed,
depending on your point of view—to keep the world and its inhabitants
together. A certain amount of creativity and rebellion must be tolerated—or
welcomed, depending on your point of view—to maintain the process of
regeneration. Every rule was once a creative act, breaking other rules.
Every creative act, genuine in its creativity, is likely to transform itself, with
time, into a useful rule. It is the living interaction between social institutions
and creative achievement that keeps the world balanced on the narrow line
between too much order and too much chaos. This is a terrible conundrum,
a true existential burden. We must support and value the past, and we need
to do that with an attitude of gratitude and respect. At the same time,
however, we must keep our eyes open—we, the visionary living—and
repair the ancient mechanisms that stabilize and support us when they falter.
Thus, we need to bear the paradox that is involved in simultaneously
respecting the walls that keep us safe and allowing in enough of what is
new and changing so that our institutions remain alive and healthy. The
very world depends for its stability and its dynamism on the subsuming of
all our endeavors under the perfection—the sacredness—of that dual ability.

How do you know who you are? After all, you are complex beyond your
own understanding; more complex than anything else that exists, excepting
other people; complex beyond belief. And your ignorance is further
complicated by the intermingling of who you are with who you could be.
You are not only something that is. You are something that is becoming—
and the potential extent of that becoming also transcends your
understanding. Everyone has the sense, I believe, that there is more to them
than they have yet allowed to be realized. That potential is often obscured
by poor health, misfortune, and the general tragedies and mishaps of life.
But it can also be hidden by an unwillingness to take full advantage of the
opportunities that life offers—abetted by regrettable errors of all sorts,
including failures of discipline, faith, imagination, and commitment. Who
are you? And, more importantly, who could you be, if you were everything
you could conceivably be?
Are such questions impossible to answer, or are there sources available
to us from which guidance might be derived? After all, we have been
observing ourselves behave—in our successes and failures—for tens
(perhaps hundreds) of thousands of years. During that time, our shamans,
prophets, mystics, artists, poets, and bards have distilled something vital
from such observations—some concentrated essence of what makes us
human in actuality and possibility. In doing so, they have provided us with
representations of that vital essence, presenting itself to us as that which can
be neither ignored nor forgotten. Those creative people write and act out the
dramas and tell us the stories that capture our imagination, and they fill our
dreams with visions of what might be. The deepest and most profound of
these are remembered, discussed, and otherwise honed collectively, and
made the focus of rituals that unite us across the centuries, forming the very
basis of our cultures. These are the stories upon which the ritual, religious,
and philosophical edifices characterizing sophisticated, populous,
successful societies are built.
The stories we can neither ignore nor forget are unforgettable for this
reason (among others): They speak to something we know, but do not know
that we know. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates believed that all
learning was a form of remembering. Socrates posited that the soul,
immortal in its essence, knew everything before it was born anew as an
infant. However, at the point of birth all previous knowledge was forgotten
and had to be recalled through the experiences of life. There is much to be
said for this hypothesis, strange as it might now appear. There is much that
we could do—much that our bodies and minds are capable of doing—that
remains dormant, right down to the genetic level. Exposure to new
experience activates this dormant potential, releasing abilities built into us
over the vast span of our evolutionary history. This is perhaps the most
basic manner in which our bodies retain past wisdom and draw upon it
when necessary. It is in this way, although not only in this way, that human
possibility exists. Thus, there is something profound to be said for the
concept of learning as remembering.
Obviously, as well as “remembering” (as in the turning on of innate but
hidden possibilities), we can learn much that is new. This is one of the
primary factors differentiating us from animals. Even complex and
intelligent mammals such as chimpanzees and dolphins tend to repeat their
species-typical behaviors generation after generation, with very little
change. Humans, by contrast, can and continually do seek out and
encounter what is new, investigate and adapt to it, and make it part of
themselves. We can, as well, translate something we already know at one
level of representation into knowledge at another. We can watch the actions
of a living creature, animal or human, and then imitate them, translating our
perceptions of their movement into new movements of our own. We can
even generalize such imitative acts, catching the “spirit” of what or whom
we are observing, and producing new ways of seeing and acting that are in
some manner similar to that spirit.* This is part of what makes up the basis
of the deeply embodied implicit knowledge that forms so much of the basis
of our true understanding. We can also observe someone act or something
occur and write down what we see, translating action into language that
outlasts its utterance—and then communicate it later in the absence of what
or whom is being described. Finally, and most mysteriously, we can
imagine and then act out something that has simply not been seen before,
something that is truly original. And we can code and represent all that
ability—adaptive action and its transformation—in the stories we tell about
those we admire, as well as those we hate. And that is how we determine
who we are, and who we could perhaps become.
Stories become unforgettable when they communicate sophisticated
modes of being—complex problems and equally complex solutions—that
we perceive, consciously, in pieces, but cannot fully articulate. It was for
this reason, for example, that the biblical story of Moses and the Israelites’
exodus from Egypt became such a powerful touchstone for black slaves
seeking emancipation in the United States:
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land
Tell old Pharaoh
To let my people go.2
The biblical story of Exodus is properly regarded as archetypal (or
paradigmatic or foundational) by psychoanalytic and religious thinkers
alike, because it presents an example of psychological and social
transformation that cannot be improved upon. It emerged as a product of
imagination and has been transformed by constant collective retelling and
reworking into an ultimately meaningful form that applies politically,
economically, historically, personally, and spiritually, all at the same time.
This is the very definition of literary depth—something that reaches its
apogee in certain forms of ancient, traditional stories. The fact of that depth
means that such accounts can be used diversely as a meaningful frame for
any process of profound change experienced by any individual or society
(stable state, descent into chaos, reestablishment of stability), and can lend
that process multidimensional reality, context, powerful meaning, and
motivation.

How might an unforgettable story come to be? What might precede its
revelation? It is at the very least the consequence of a long period of
observation. Imagine a scientist monitoring the behavior of a wolf pack, or
a troop of chimps—indeed, any group of complex social animals. He or she
attempts to identify regularities in the behavior of the individuals and the
group (patterns, in a word) and to articulate those regularities—to
encapsulate them in language. The scientist might first relate a series of
anecdotes about animal actions emblematic of the general behavior of the
species. He or she might then abstract even further, attempting to generalize
across anecdotes with rule-like descriptions. I say “rule-like” because the
animals are not following rules. Rules require language. Animals are
merely acting out regularities. They cannot formulate, understand, or follow
rules.
But human beings? We can observe ourselves acting, as a scientist might
—more accurately, as a storyteller might. Then we can tell the stories to
each other. The stories are already distillations of observed behavior (if they
are not distillations, they will not be interesting; relating a sequence of
everyday actions does not make for a good story). Once the story is
established, we can analyze it, looking for deeper patterns and regularities.
If that analysis is successful, we can generalize across anecdotes with the
formulation of rules, and then we can learn, consciously, to follow those
rules. Here is how this might happen. We all react judgmentally when a
child or adult—or, indeed, a society—is acting improperly, unfairly, or
badly. The error strikes us emotionally. We intuit that a pattern upon which
individual and social adaptation depends has been disrupted and violated.
We are annoyed, frustrated, hurt, or grief-stricken at the betrayal. This does
not mean that each of us, reacting emotionally, has been successful at
articulating a comprehensive philosophy of good and evil. We may never
put our finger on what has gone wrong. However, like children unfamiliar
with a new game but still able to play it, we know that the rules are being
broken.
Something precisely like this is portrayed in the biblical story of Exodus,
the ancient account of the flight of the Hebrew slaves from their Egyptian
masters. Moses, who leads the escaping people, is continually called upon
by his followers to draw very fine moral distinctions when they struggle
with one another and seek his advice. In consequence, he spends a very
long time observing and contemplating their behavior. It is as if the desert
prophet had to discover what rules he and his Israelite followers were
already struggling to act out, prior to his receipt of the explicit
commandments from God. Remember: Every society is already
characterized by patterned behavior; otherwise it would be pure conflict and
no “society” at all. But the mere fact that social order reigns to some degree
does not mean that a given society has come to explicitly understand its
own behavior, its own moral code. It is therefore no accident that in this
story Moses serves as a judge for his followers—and does so with sufficient
duration and intensity to exhaust himself—before he receives the Ten
Commandments:
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto
the evening.
And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the
people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people?
why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee
from morning unto even?
And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people
come unto me to inquire of God:
When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes
of God, and his laws.
And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
doest is not good.
Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to
perform it thyself alone. (Exodus 18: 13–18)
This difficult exercise in discrimination and judgment, observing and
weighing, is an integral part of what prepared the biblical patriarch for the
receipt of divine revelation. If there had been no behavioral base for those
rules—no historical precedent codified in traditional ethics, no conventions,
and no endless hours of observation of the moral patterns—the
commandments simply could not have been understood and communicated,
much less obeyed. An unforgettable story captures the essence of humanity and distills,
communicates, and clarifies it, bringing what we are and what we should be
into focus. It speaks to us, motivating the attention that inspires us to
imitate. We learn to see and act in the manner of the heroes of the stories
that captivate us. These stories call to capacities that lie deep within our
nature but might still never develop without that call. We are dormant
adventurers, lovers, leaders, artists, and rebels, but need to discover that we
are all those things by seeing the reflection of such patterns in dramatic and
literary form. That is part of being a creature that is part nature and part
culture. An unforgettable story advances our capacity to understand our
behavior, beyond habit and expectation, toward an imaginative and then
verbalized understanding. Such a story presents us in the most compelling
manner with the ultimate adventure, the divine romance, and the eternal
battle between good and evil. All this helps us clarify our understanding of
moral and immoral attitude and action, personal and social. This can be
seen everywhere, and always.
Question: Who are you—or, at least, who could you be? Answer: Part of
the eternal force that constantly confronts the terrible unknown, voluntarily;
part of the eternal force that transcends naivete and becomes dangerous
enough, in a controlled manner, to understand evil and beard it in its lair;
and part of the eternal force that faces chaos and turns it into productive
order, or that takes order that has become too restrictive, reduces it to chaos,
and renders it productive once again.
And all of this, being very difficult to understand consciously but vital to
our survival, is transmitted in the form of the stories that we cannot help but
attend to. And it is in this manner that we come to apprehend what is of
value, what we should aim at, and what we could be. I would like to try my hand at explaining the meaning of the illustration,
based on an ancient alchemical woodcut, that opens this chapter. Describing
what it signifies reveals how much information can be contained within an
image without the viewer possessing any explicit understanding of its
contents (such a picture is in fact better considered an early stage in the
process by which such explicit understanding develops). The ancient
alchemist* who produced the picture was dreaming, in a very real sense,
while doing so—dreaming about what a person could be, and how that
might come about.
At the very base of the image is a winged sphere. Atop that perches a
dragon. Standing on the dragon is a two-headed human figure—one head
male, the other female. The male head is associated with an image of the
Sun; the female, with the Moon. In between but also above the two heads is
the symbol for Mercury: god, planet, and metal, simultaneously. A variety
of additional symbols round out the picture. Everything portrayed is
enveloped in an egg-shaped container. This arrangement indicates that the
image is of many things inside one thing—a multiplicity in a unity—just as
an unhatched chick is encapsulated within a single container but is many
increasingly differentiated and complex biological parts, particularly in its
later stages of development. In its entirety, the image is labeled materia
prima—Latin for the “primal element.”
The alchemists regarded the materia prima as the fundamental substance
from which everything else—matter and spirit included, equally—emerged,
or was derived. You can profitably consider that primal element the
potential we face when we confront the future, including our future selves
—or the potential we cannot help upbraiding ourselves and others for
wasting. It can also be usefully conceptualized as the information from
which we build ourselves and the world, instead of the matter out of which
we generally consider reality composed. Each interpretation—potential and
information—has its advantages.
What does it mean that the world can be usefully considered as potential
or information? Think about what happens, for example, when you stop by
the mailbox and pick up your mail. Consider, as well, what that mail is
“made of.” Materially speaking, it is merely paper and ink. But that material
substrate is essentially irrelevant. It would not matter if the message was
delivered by email or voice—or in Morse code, for that matter. What is
relevant is the content. And that means that each piece of mail is a container
of content—of potential or information, positive, neutral, or negative.
Maybe, for example, it is a notification of investigation from your country’s
tax department. This means that, despite its apparently harmless presence in
your hand, the letter is tightly and inextricably connected to a gigantic,
complex and oft-arbitrary structure that may well not have your best
interests in mind. Alternatively, perhaps it is something joyful, such as an
unexpected letter from someone loved or a long-awaited check. From such
a perspective, an envelope is a container—a mysterious container, at least in
potential—from which an entire new world might emerge.
Everyone understands this idea, even if they do not know it. If you have
been having trouble with the tax authorities, for example, and you receive
an official piece of mail from their agency, your blood pressure will
increase (or drop precipitously), your heart will pound, your palms will
sweat, and a feeling of intense fear, even doom, may sweep over you. That
is the instinctive response, associated with preparation for action, that
accompanies exposure to danger. And now you will have to decide: are you
going to open the letter and face what is “inside”? And, having done so, are
you going to think your way through the problem, terrible as that might be,
and begin to address it? Or are you going to ignore what you now know,
pretend that everything is all right (even though you know, emotionally—as
a consequence of your anxiety—that it is not), and pay the inevitable
psychological and physical price? It is the former route that will require you
to voluntarily confront what you are afraid of—the terrible, abstract
monster—and, hypothetically, to become stronger and more integrated as a
result. It is the latter route that will leave the problem in its monstrous form
and force you to suffer like a scared animal confronted by a predator’s
vicious eyes in the pitch of night.
A winged sphere, inscribed with a square, a triangle, and the numerals 3
and 4 occupies the bottom third of the image in question.* This singular
entity or object was known by the alchemists as the “round chaos.”3
 It is a
container—the initial container of the primordial element—the container of
what the world, and the psyche, consists of before it becomes differentiated.
This is the potential, or information. This is what attracts your attention
unconsciously and compels you to attend to something before you know
why it has gripped your interest. This is when and where what is new makes
its entrance into what is predictable and certain (for better or worse); what
flits about you, with little voluntary control—as if it is something winged—
as your imagination and your attention move unpredictably but
meaningfully from association to association; and it is what you are looking
at when you have no idea what it is you are confronting. Finally, it is what
you cannot look away from when you are possessed by horror, even as such
potential for horror simultaneously adds vital interest to life.
Strangely, the round chaos may be familiar to modern audiences (again,
even if they do not know it), because of the Harry Potter series of books and
films. J. K. Rowling, the series author, takes some pains to describe a
sporting event, Quidditch, which helps to define and unify Hogwarts. The
point of Quidditch is to drive a ball (the Quaffle) through one of the three
hoops guarded by the opposing team, while flying about the playing pitch
on enchanted brooms. Success in doing so gains the scorer’s team 10 points.
Simultaneously, two separate players (one from each team) play another
game—a game within the game. Chosen for their exceptional skill in
attention and flight, these two competitors—known as Seekers—attempt to
locate, chase, and capture a winged ball, the Snitch, which is identical in
appearance to the round chaos that sits at the bottom of the alchemist’s
image. The Snitch is golden—indicating its exceptional value and purity*—
and zips around chaotically, at a very fast rate, darting, weaving, bobbing,
and racing the Seekers as they pursue it astride their brooms. If a Seeker
captures the Snitch, his or her team gains 150 points (typically enough to
ensure victory) and the entire game comes to an end. This indicates that
chasing and capturing whatever is represented by the Snitch—and, by
implication, the round chaos—is a goal whose importance supersedes any
other.* Why is Rowling’s game, conjured up for us by her deep
imagination, structured in that manner? What does her narrative idea
signify? There are two ways of answering these questions (although both
answers relate importantly to each other):
First: In Rule I, we discussed the idea that the true winner of any game is
the person who plays fair. This is because playing fair, despite the
particularities of any given game, is a higher-order accomplishment than
mere victory. Striving to play fair, in the ultimate sense—following the
spirit of the rules, as well as the letter—is an indication of true personality
development, predicated as it is on concern for true reciprocity. The Seekers
of the Snitch must ignore the details of the game of Quidditch, of which
they are still a part, while attempting to find and seize the Snitch, just as the
player of a real-world game must ignore the particularities of that game
while attending to what constitutes truly ethical play, regardless of what is
happening on the playing field. Thus, the ethical player, like the Seeker,
indomitably pursues what is most valuable in the midst of complex,
competing obligations.
Second: Among the alchemists, the round chaos was associated with the
winged god Mercury, who served as messenger from the realm of the
divine, guide of souls to the underworld, and bringer of good fortune. It is
for this reason that the ancient symbol for Mercury is located at the very
pinnacle (the most important location) of the image in question. It is an
attempt to indicate what guides the process that the picture represents.
Centuries ago, prior to the dawn of modern chemistry, the god Mercury
represented what inspires or attracts interest involuntarily. He was the spirit
who possessed a person when his or her attention was drawn irresistibly to
some person, situation, or event. Imagine that there are very complex
processes going on in your mind unconsciously, highlighting events of
potential worth and distinguishing them from everything else constantly
unfolding around you. Imagine that those processes that distinguish value
are alive, which is certainly the case, and that they are complex and
integrated enough to be conceptualized as a personality. That is Mercury.
The draw he exerts on our attention reveals itself in a sense of significance
—in the sense that something happening around you is worth attending to,
or contains something of value. The Seeker—in real life, as well as in
Rowling’s Potter series and its Quidditch game—is he or she who takes that
sense of significance more seriously than anything else. The Seeker is
therefore the person who is playing the game that everyone else is playing
(and who is disciplined and expert at the game), but who is also playing an
additional, higher-order game: the pursuit of what is of primary
significance. The Snitch (like the round chaos) can therefore be considered
the “container” of that primary significance—that meaning—and, therefore,
something revelatory when pursued and caught. We might in this context
remember what has come to be known as the Golden Rule: “And as ye
would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise” (Luke 6:31).
There is nothing more important than learning to strive under difficult and
frustrating circumstances to play fair. This is what should be chased, so to
speak, during any game (even though it is also important to try to obtain
victory in the game).*
Each of us, when fortunate, is compelled forward by something that
grips our attention—love of a person; a sport; a political, sociological, or
economic problem, or a scientific question; a passion for art, literature, or
drama—something that calls to us for reasons we can neither control nor
understand (try to make yourself interested in something you just do not
care about and see how well that works). The phenomena that grip us
(phenomena: from the Greek word phainesthai, “to appear, or to be brought
to light”) are like lamps along a dark path: they are part of the unconscious
processes devoted to integrating and furthering the development of our
spirits, the furtherance of our psychological development. You do not
choose what interests you. It chooses you. Something manifests itself out of
the darkness as compelling, as worth living for; following that, something
moves us further down the road, to the next meaningful manifestation—and
so it goes, as we continue to seek, develop, grow, and thrive. It is a perilous
journey, but it is also the adventure of our lives. Think of pursuing someone
you love: catch them or not, you change in the process. Think, as well, of
the traveling you have done, or of the work you have undertaken, whether
for pleasure or necessity. In all these cases you experience what is new.
Sometimes that is painful; sometimes it is better than anything else that has
ever happened to you. Either way, it is deeply informative. It is all part of
the potential of the world, calling you into Being, changing you forever—
for better or worse—in consequence of your pursuit.
Atop the round chaos perches a dragon. This is because what is
interesting and meaningful (and novel and unexpected, as those all go
together) manifests itself in a form that is both dangerous and promising,
particularly when its grip is intense and irresistible. The danger is, of
course, signified by the presence of the immortal, predatory reptile; the
promise is hinted at, as a dragon archetypally guards a great treasure. Thus,
the drawing represents a psychological progression. First, you find yourself
interested in something. That something (the round chaos) contains or is
composed of potential, or information. If it is pursued and caught, it
releases that information. Out of that information we build the world we
perceive, and we build ourselves as perceivers. Thus, the round chaos is the
container from which both matter (the world) and spirit (our psyches)
emerge. There is some numerological indication of this on the spherical
body of the round chaos itself: the number 3, accompanied by a triangle,
which is traditionally associated with spirit (because of its association with
the Holy Trinity), and the number 4, associated with the world of matter
(because of its association with the four traditional elements: earth, water,
wind, and fire). The dragon, in turn, perched on top of the round chaos,
represents the danger and possibility of the information within.
Atop the dragon stands a figure known as a Rebis, a single body with
two heads, one male, one female. The Rebis is a symbol of the fully
developed personality that can emerge from forthright and courageous
pursuit of what is meaningful (the round chaos) and dangerous and
promising (the dragon). It has a symbolically masculine aspect, which
typically stands for exploration, order, and rationality (indicated by the Sun,
which can be seen to the left of the male head), and a symbolically feminine
aspect, which stands for chaos, promise, care, renewal, and emotion
(indicated by the Moon, to the right of the female). In the course of normal
socialization, it is typical for one of these aspects to become more
developed than the other (as males are socialized in the male manner, to
which they are also inclined biologically, and females in the female
manner). Nonetheless, it is possible—with enough exploration, enough
exposure to the round chaos and the dragon—to develop both elements.
That constitutes an ideal—or so goes the alchemical intuition.
Out of the unknown—the potential that makes up the world—comes the
terrible but promising form of the dragon, peril and promise united. It is an
eternal dichotomy echoed by the presence of the two remaining symbols to
the right and above the dragon’s tail: Jupiter, representing the positive, and
Saturn, the negative. Out of the confrontation with peril and promise
emerges the masculine and feminine aspects of the psyche, working
together in harmony. Guiding the process is the spirit Mercurius,
manifesting itself as meaning in the world, working through unconscious
means to attract exploration to what will unite the various discordant and
warring elements of the personality. This can all be read, appropriately, as a
story of the development of the ideal personality—an attempt, in image, to
describe what each of us could be.

Now we are going to attempt a description of “who you could be” from
another perspective, taken from one of the earliest stories we have been
fortunate enough to rediscover. In the ancient Mesopotamian Enuma Elish
(translation: When on High) we have the oldest near-complete hero myth
known, estimated at four thousand years of age in its written form and, no
doubt, far older as an oral tradition. The story begins when the primordial
goddess Tiamat, embodiment of salt water (as well as a monstrous aquatic
dragon), enters into sexual union with her equally primordial male consort,
Apsu, the embodiment of fresh water. This union gives rise to the initial
realm of being, inhabited by the elder gods, the first children of Tiamat and
Apsu.
To understand the beginning of this story, we need to know a few things
the ancients held to be fundamentally true. These are markedly different
from the truths of modern science. Before the dawn of the scientific
worldview, a mere six hundred years ago, reality was construed as all that
which human beings experience. That which we experience can be
distinguished, conceptually, from reality as objective world—pure physical
being—by its more comprehensive contents, which include subjective
experiences such as emotions, dreams, visions, and motivational states such
as hunger, thirst, and pain. That which we experience is better compared to
a novel or a movie, which concentrates on the communication and sharing
of subjective as well as objective states, than is reality as objective world,
which we might liken to a scientific description of physical reality. It is the
actual, particular, and unique demise of someone you love, for example,
compared to the listing of that death in the hospital records. It is the drama
of lived experience. It is because our own experience is genuinely literary,
narrative, embodied, and storylike that we are so attracted to fictional
representations. Movies, plays, operas, TV dramas—even the lyrics of
songs—help us deal with our lived experiences, which are something
different and broader than the mere material from which our experience
hypothetically rises.
Engaging with the first part of the Enuma Elish requires us to understand
a second fundamental realization of the ancients: the fundamentally social
nature of our cognitive categories. That is why everything is personified in
children’s books: the Sun, the Moon, toys, animals—even machines. We see
nothing strange in this, because it so profoundly mirrors our perceptual
tendencies. We expect children to view and understand the world in this
manner, and we can easily fall back into doing so ourselves. Something
should be clarified here: It is not truly accurate to state that the reality
portrayed in children’s fiction is personified. It is the case, instead (and this
is a genuine reversal of the presumption in question), that we directly and
naturally perceive reality as personified, and then must work very diligently
to strip that personification away, so that we can detect “objective reality.”*
We understand reality, therefore, as if it is constructed of personalities. That
is because so much of what we encounter in our hypersocial reality, our
complex societies, is in fact personality—and gendered personality, at that,
reflecting the billion years or so since the emergence of sexual reproduction
(ample time for its existence to have profoundly structured our perceptions).
We understand male, and abstract from that the masculine. We understand
female, and abstract from that the feminine. Finally, we understand the
child, and abstract from that, most commonly, the son. These basic
divisions are clearly reflected in the creation story of the Enuma Elish, just
as they are reflected in, or more accurately underpin, our understanding of
the stories we all know.
Tiamat, the primordial goddess, is chaos, a female monster, a dragon.
She is the terror of nature, creative and destructive, mother and slayer of us
all. Apsu, her husband, is the eternal father. He is the order that we depend
upon for security, and by which we are simultaneously tyrannized.* These
two most primal of deities come together in a productive, sexual union,
“mingling their waters,” in the ancient words. In this fashion, they produce
their first progeny, the elder gods of Mesopotamia. These gods represent
elements of the world more differentiated than the primordial mother and
father—such as heaven and earth, mud and silt, and war and fire.*
However, they are also careless, noisy, and impulsive as two-year-old
children (who are, after all, primal forces in their own right). Their
continual ceaseless, thoughtless activity and general unconsciousness
culminates in a catastrophe: their mutual decision to wage war upon and
then slay Apsu, and consequent attempt to build a stable dwelling place on
his corpse.
Tiamat—chaos itself—already irritated by the brainless racket of her
children, is murderously enraged by the heedless slaughter of her husband.
The Terrible Goddess builds an army of eleven monsters to deal with her
wayward offspring, placing a demonic figure named Kingu, whom she
takes as a second husband, at their head, and delivering to him the Tablet of
Destinies (indicating his authority as ultimate ruler of the universe). The
relationship between this brilliant dramatic representation and how we use,
or misuse, the gifts of our culture is obvious: the careless demolition of
tradition is the invitation to the (re)emergence of chaos. When ignorance
destroys culture, monsters will emerge.
While Tiamat busily arranges her army, the elder gods continue their
activity, pairing off, producing children, and then grandchildren, of their
own. One of the latter, Marduk, appears particularly talented, powerful, and
promising. He is born with eyes encircling his head. He can see
everywhere. He can speak magic words. He is something entirely new—
and this is noted early by his progenitors. While Marduk matures, the elder
gods are compelled to confront Tiamat, with whom they are now at war.
One after another they attempt to defeat her. All return in abject failure.
Finally, someone suggests that Marduk, though still young, should be sent
to confront his terrible grandmother. Approached with this idea, he agrees,
but only on the condition that he is awarded the right, henceforth—if he is
victorious—to hold the Tablet of Destinies, and sit atop the dominance
hierarchy of the gods.
It is in this manner that this ancient story describes the emergence of
monotheism out of polytheism. The Enuma Elish appears to be a
dramatized account of the psychological or spiritual processes comprising
this transformation. The ancient Mesopotamian civilization faced the
necessity of incorporating and unifying many diverse tribes and peoples,
each of whom had their own gods. The god who arose out of the conflict
between all those gods (“Whose god is supreme?”) was, therefore, a metagod—a god composed of what was most important about all gods. It was
for such a reason, for example, that fifty different names characterized
Marduk. This emergence of one from many is a very common process,
described by the scholar of myth Mircea Eliade as the war of the gods in
heaven, a typical mythological motif, as well as alluded to earlier.* It is the
psychological counterpart, in the world of imagination, to the genuine
struggle of concepts of divinity and value on earth. Tribes unite. Each has
its gods. The people comprising these multitudinous groups go to war,
concretely and conceptually, for what they believe—sometimes for
generations. It is as if the gods they follow were battling for dominance
over periods exceeding single human lives, using their followers as proxies.
That is reflected in the ancient stories. If and when the gods come to an
agreement about their relative positions—more particularly, if they arrange
themselves into a hierarchy—it means that peace has genuinely been
established, because peace is the establishment of a shared hierarchy of
divinity, of value. Thus, an eternal question emerges whenever people of
different backgrounds are required to deal with one another on a relatively
permanent basis: What do all gods share that makes them gods? What is
God, in essence?
That is a very difficult question. It is, on the one hand, the question of
value: What is of the highest importance? It is, on the other hand, the
question of sovereignty: What principle should rule? These are the
questions posed by those pondering the ultimate source of divine
significance itself. Their difficulty meant that they, and by extension the
question of God, had to be answered over centuries, over millennia. The
answer emerged first in story form. The Mesopotamians brilliantly intuited
that the highest god—the highest good—involved careful attention (the
multiple, head-circling eyes of Marduk) and effective language (the magic
words of Marduk, capable of generating a cosmos), in addition to the
courage and strength to voluntarily confront and overcome chaos, the
unknown. It could be argued that these are the defining features of the great
central spirit of mankind, at least insofar as that spirit is noble and
admirable.
The ancient Egyptians formulated an idea similar in many important
regards—which we will discuss later in detail—associating their savior-god
Horus, son of Osiris, with the sharp-eyed falcon, and identifying him with
the vision willing to search out, detect, understand, and defeat evil
(symbolized with the famous Egyptian image of the single eye).
Representing that reality—pay attention, above all, even to what is
monstrous and malevolent, and speak wisely and truthfully—could be the
single most important accomplishment of our species.4
 It allows us to
apprehend in dramatic form the fundamental necessity of coming to grips
with what our senses demonstrate to us, no matter how terrifying the reality
revealed. It allows for the possibility of bringing our explicit understanding
closer in line with our deepest being, making possible a truer union of body
and spirit through the partial comprehension and imitation of the story.
Most importantly, perhaps, it allows us to realize the immense importance
of words in transforming potential into actuality, and helps us understand
that the role we each play in that transformation is in some vital sense akin
to the divine.
After his election to the highest of places, Marduk challenges Tiamat
directly, encloses her, defeated, in a giant net, and cuts her into pieces,
fashioning the heavens and the earth from her remains. One of Marduk’s
many names is, in fact, “he who makes ingenious things as a consequence
of the conflict with Tiamat.”5
 It might be noted, in this regard, that tens of
thousands of years ago, men literally did construct the habitable world out
of the pieces of monsters, making their early dwellings from the giant bones
of animals they had so courageously speared.6
 Marduk simultaneously
defeats his grandmother’s monstrous army, including the leader, Kingu,
from whom he takes the Tablet of Destinies, confirming his place as
supreme leader of the cosmos. Then he returns home, enemies in tow. His
compatriots celebrate his victory and accede yet more completely to his
leadership, before he assigns them their various duties. Then, after
consulting Ea, the god of wisdom, Marduk determines to create man, to aid
the gods most fundamentally in the eternal task of maintaining the proper
balance between order and chaos—to release those very gods from their
service, and to transfer their burden onto our all-too-human shoulders.*
The basic story is this: when order (Apsu) is carelessly threatened or
destroyed, the terrible forces of chaos from which the world was originally
derived appear once again in their most destructive, monstrous, predatory
guise. Then a hero, representing the highest of values, must arise or be
elected to confront this chaotic force. He does so successfully, deriving or
producing something of great worth. What the hero represents is the most
important of the great forces that make up the human psyche. To think of it
another way: the hero is the embodied principle of action and perception
that must rule over all the primordial psychological elements of lust, rage,
hunger, thirst, terror, and joy. For chaos to remain effectively at bay (or,
even better, tamed and therefore harnessed), this heroic principle must be
regarded as the most important of all things that can organize and motivate
mankind. This means, at least, that it must be continually acted out, which
is what “regarded as important” actually means. It is in this way that the
spirit of Marduk still possesses each individual who engages courageously
in the processes of encounter and confrontation that eternally create and
renew society. It is this that happens when each small child learns to
regulate and unite his emotions and motivations into a coherent personality,
and then goes out to challenge the unknown world.
In slightly altered form, this is the story of St. George: The inhabitants of
an ancient city must obtain water from a well beside the nest of a dragon.
To do so, however, they have to offer the dragon some sacrifice—a sheep,
under most circumstances, but a maiden, if no sheep can be found. The
young women of the city draw lots when the supply of sheep is exhausted.
One day it is the daughter of the king herself who loses. St. George appears,
confronts the dragon with the sign of the cross—symbol of the eternal
Redeemer, the archetypal hero—and frees the doomed princess. The city’s
inhabitants then convert to Christianity. Victory over the dragon—the
predator, as such, the ruler of unexplored territory—is victory over all the
forces that have threatened the individual and society, over evolutionary and
historical spans of time, as well as the more abstract evil we all still face,
without and within. The cross, for its part, is the burden of life. It is a place
of betrayal, torture, and death. It is therefore a fundamental symbol of
mortal vulnerability. In the Christian drama, it is also the place where
vulnerability is transcended, as a consequence of its acceptance. This
voluntary acceptance is also equivalent to victory over the dragon,
representation of chaos, death, and the unknown. By accepting life’s
suffering, therefore, evil may be overcome. The alternative is hell, at least
in its psychological form: rage, resentment, and the desire for revenge and
destruction.
The same story is echoed in the tales of St. Patrick, who chases the
snakes out of Ireland, and St. Michael, who defeats the Christian equivalent
of Kingu, “that ancient serpent called the devil” (Revelation 12:9). This is
the same story recounted by J. R. R. Tolkien in The Hobbit, which was in
turn derived from the ancient poem Beowulf, the tale of a hero defeating a
pair of intelligent monsters—son, and then worse, mother.
7
 In The Hobbit,
the hero develops character and wisdom (as a thief, strangely enough)
during his quest to help discover the ancient treasure hoarded by the dragon.
The story of Perseus and Medusa, whose visage was so terrible that it
turned onlookers to stone, is another variant, as is Pinocchio, who rescues
his father from a subaquatic monster, and dies and is reborn while doing so.
Something similar is portrayed in the first of the recent Avengers movies, in
which Iron Man—the man who has transformed himself into a partly
golden superhero—defeats the alien dragon worms of the Chitauri (allied
with the satanic Loki). He then dies, is reborn, and gets the maiden (in the
nonswooning guise of Ms. Pepper Potts). It must be understood: Such
stories would not even be comprehensible (not least to children, as well as
adults) if our evolutionary history had importantly differed, and if our entire
culture had not been shaped, implicitly and explicitly, by these ancient
patterns.
All these heroes act out what was perhaps the greatest discovery ever
made by man’s primordial ancestors: if you have the vision and the courage
(and a good stout stick, when necessary), you can chase away the worst of
snakes. No doubt the greatest of our ancestors were beginning to threaten
snakes with sticks when we still lived in trees. No doubt it was those
voluntarily snake-chasing ancestors who reaped the benefits of their bravery
in the form of nearby grateful maidens (or their ancestral arboreal
equivalents)—and perhaps this is why dragons hoard virgins, as well as
gold. What constitutes the worst of all snakes and the stoutest of all sticks,
however, might be regarded as the central religious questions of humanity.
It is interesting to note that in The Hobbit, the worst snake is “only” a
dragon, but in The Lord of the Rings, the worst snake, so to speak, is the
much more abstract evil of the wizard Sauron. As humanity became more
sophisticated in its capacity to abstract, we increasingly appreciated the fact
that predatory monsters can come in many guises, only some of which are
animal in their form. Literature of an arguably more sophisticated form
endlessly echoes this realization.

In the second volume of J. K. Rowling’s fantasy series, Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets, the castle of Hogwarts is threatened by strange,
chaotic forces, due to the earlier and ongoing misbehavior of several
powerful adult wizards (as established in volume one). Now, it is significant
that Harry is orphaned: it is an integral part of the heroic pattern. He has his
earthly parents, the thick and conventional Dursleys, willfully blind,
shortsighted, and terribly overprotective of (and, therefore, tragically
dangerous to) Dudley, their unfortunate but predictably self-centered and
bullying natural son. But Harry has his heavenly parents, too, his true
mother and father—symbolically, Nature and Culture (variants of chaos and
order). They exist as part of his intrinsically magical potential—the magical
potential of all of us, in fact, as we are all children of Nature and Culture,
with the tremendous potential that implies, as well as the more mundane
offspring of our particular parents.8
When Harry returns to Hogwarts after his summer vacation, he can
detect strange and ominous noises emanating from somewhere in the
building. At the same time, various students and residents of Hogwarts are
found paralyzed—turned to stone—in diverse locations around the building.
Turned to stone: What could that possibly mean? It certainly means to be
unable to move—but it also signifies something deeper. It means to be
hunted; to become a rabbit confronted by a wolf; to become the horrified
and awestruck object of the predatory gaze. Many herbivores,
comparatively defenseless, facing imminent and brutal death, freeze in
place, paralyzed by fear, depending on camouflage and immobility to
render them invisible to the terrible intentions of nearby red-toothed and
razor-clawed carnivores. Predatory, reptilian forms still particularly have
that effect on human beings (hence our awed fascination, for example, with
dinosaurs). But to have no more courage than a rabbit is definitely not to be
everything you could be.
Eventually Harry learns that the force turning his friends into stone is a
gigantic snake, a basilisk, whose gaze exerts a paralyzing force. He
discovers that this serpent is continually slithering around the very
foundation of Hogwarts, in the immense waterworks that serve the great
castle. This basilisk is an analog to the great dragon faced by Beowulf, hero
of the thousand-year-old story that served as pattern for Tolkien’s
adventures, perhaps the twentieth century’s closest cousins to J. K.
Rowling’s extensive fantasy. It is, as well, the great devouring shark of the
movie Jaws, lurking in the black water of night, ready at a moment’s notice
to pull the naked and unwary below; the fragility of our homes and our
institutions, which can collapse and leave us stripped of their protective
walls in a single terrible moment; and more comprehensively, the
underworld of the ancients, whose doors gape open when everything
predictable collapses. At the deepest of levels, this is the chaos and
potential that continually lurks under the order of our familiar worlds,
psychological and social.
After much searching, Harry gains entrance to this underworld labyrinth
of pipes and tunnels, and finds the central chamber. He does this,
significantly, through the sewer, acting out the ancient alchemical dictum, in
sterquilinis invenitur: in filth it will be found.* What does this mean? That
which you most need to find will be found where you least wish to look.*
There, underground, Ginny (Virgin-ia), his best friend’s sister and Harry’s
eventual serious romantic interest, lies unconscious. She is the maiden—or
the anima, the soul—forever incarcerated by the dragon, as in the tale of St.
George. It is up to Harry, orphaned hero, to wake and rescue her (just as
Tolkien’s Bilbo helps take the gold from the terrible Smaug; just as
Disney’s Prince Phillip rescues Sleeping Beauty—both rescuing what is
most valuable from the clutches of a great dragon).*
And of course, the unknown is a great predator—the basilisk Harry faces
—and of course, that predator guards a great treasure, gold beyond measure
or the sleeping virgin, because the individual brave enough to voluntarily
beard the serpent in his lair is most likely to gain access to the untold riches
that exist in potential, awaiting us in the adventure of our life, away from
security and what is currently known. Who dares wins*—if he does not
perish. And who wins also makes himself irresistibly desirable and
attractive, not least because of the development of character that adventure
inevitably produces. And this is what makes us forever more than rabbits.
And Harry, like Bilbo, can only manage this—can only perceive the
serpent, when it is invisible to everyone else—because he has a dark side.
Tolkien’s Bilbo must become a thief before he can become a hero. He must
incorporate his monstrousness, so that he can supersede his naive
harmlessness, before he is tough enough to face the terrors that confront
him. Harry is touched by evil in another manner, as part of the
incomparably dark wizard Voldemort’s soul is embedded within him
(although neither he nor Voldemort are initially aware of this). It is for this
reason that the young wizard can speak with and hear (that is, perceive)
snakes. It is in keeping with this that he is disciplined and courageous, but
also willing and ready to break the rules when necessary.
While in the bowels of Hogwarts, Harry comes under attack by the
basilisk, which is under the control of Voldemort. Voldemort therefore bears
the same relationship to the basilisk in Hogwarts as Satan does, strangely
and incomprehensibly, to the vision-granting serpent in the Genesis story of
the Garden of Eden. Why might this be? It could be said—and should be—
that one form of serpentine chaos and danger is the threat of the reptilian
predator itself. But another form, more abstract—more psychological, more
spiritual—is human evil: the danger we pose to one another. At some point
in our evolutionary and cultural history, we began to understand that human
evil could rightly be considered the greatest of all snakes. So, the symbolic
progression might be (1) snake as evil predator, then (2) external human
enemy as snake/evil/predator, then (3) subjective, personal, or
psychological darkness/vengefulness/deceit as snake/evil/predator. Each of
these representations, which took untold centuries, perhaps millennia to
conceptualize, constitute a tangible increase in the sophistication of the
image of evil.9
All such manifestations of serpentine chaos and danger are apparently
still first detected, processed, and symbolically interassociated by the
ancient brain systems that evolved to protect us from predatory reptiles.10
And freezing—prompted by those systems—solves the problem now,
maybe, by hiding the individual who is currently being preyed upon, but it
leaves the predator alive for tomorrow. Instead, the danger must be hunted
down and destroyed—and even that is too concrete to constitute a
permanent solution to the problem of evil itself (rather than a solution to
any particular exemplar of evil). Most profoundly and abstractly
(paralleling the idea that the greatest predator, the greatest snake, is the evil
that lurks within), evil’s destruction manifests as the life of virtue that
constrains malevolence in its most abstracted and comprehensive form. It is
for this reason, for example, that the Disney prince Phillip of Sleeping
Beauty fame is armed for his conflict with the great Dragon of Chaos by
benevolent Nature (in the form of the feminine fairies that accompany him
and aid in his escape from Maleficent, the Evil Queen) with the Sword of
Truth and Shield of Virtue.
Harry directly confronts the basilisk, down in the Chamber of Secrets,
deep below the wizarding castle, but is cornered and in great peril. At that
propitious moment, a phoenix kept by the wise headmaster of Hogwarts
arrives, provides the young hero with a sword, and then attacks the giant
snake, providing Harry with time to regroup. Harry slays the basilisk with
the weapon, but is fatally bitten in the process. This is another deep
mythological echo: In the story of Genesis, for example, the encounter with
the snake proves fatal to man and woman alike, who become aware of their
fragility and inevitable death soon after they awaken and gain vision. It is
also a harsh truth: predators devour, dragons lay waste, chaos destroys. The
threat is real. Even truth, virtue, and courage are not necessarily enough, but
they are our best bet. And sometimes a little death is the medication
necessary to forestall death itself. Fortunately, the phoenix has magical,
revivifying tears, which it cries into Harry’s wounds. Thus, the young
wizard revives, defeats Voldemort (a much more challenging task than
merely overcoming the gargantuan serpent), rescues Ginny, and saves the
school.
It is with the introduction of the phoenix to the story of St. George that
Rowling reveals another element of her intuitive genius. The phoenix is a
fowl that can die and be reborn forever. It has, therefore, throughout the
ages, been a symbol of Christ, with whom the magical bird shares many
features. It is also, equally, that element of the individual human personality
that must die and regenerate, as it learns, painfully, through the oft-tragic
experience that destroys previous certainty, replacing it first with doubt, and
then—when successfully confronted—with new and more complete
knowledge. A voluntary death-and-rebirth transformation—the change
necessary to adapt when terrible things emerge—is therefore a solution to
the potentially fatal rigidity of erroneous certainty, excessive order, and
stultification.

People exchange information about how to act in many ways. They observe
each other and imitate what they see. When they imitate, they use their
bodies to represent the bodies of others. But this imitation is not mindless,
automatized mimicry. It is instead the ability to identify regularities or
patterns in the behavior of other people, and then to imitate those patterns.
When a young girl plays at being a mother, for example, she does not
duplicate, gesture for gesture, what she has previously observed of her
mother’s actions. Instead she acts “as if” she were a mother. If you ask the
girl what she is doing, she will tell you that she is pretending to be a mother,
but if you get her to describe what that means, particularly if she is a young
child, her description will be far less complete than her actions would
indicate. This means she can act out more than she can say—just as we all
can. If you observed many little girls, acting out many mothers, you could
derive a very good idea of what “mother” meant, in its purest form, even if
you had never seen an actual mother. If you were good with words, then
perhaps you could describe the essential elements of maternal behavior and
transmit them. You might do that best in the form of a story.
It is easier and more direct to represent a behavioral pattern with
behavior than with words. Outright mimicry does that directly, action for
action. Imitation, which can produce new behaviors akin to those that
motivated the mimicry, takes that one step further. Drama—formalized
imitation, enacted upon a stage—is precisely behavior portraying behavior,
but distilled ever closer to the essence. Literature takes that transmission
one more difficult step, portraying action in the imagination of the writer
and the reader, in the complete absence of both real actors and a material
stage. It is only the greatest of storytellers who can manage that
transformation, representing the greatest and most vitally necessary of acts
in the most interesting, profound, and memorable words. Generations of
great storytellers, retelling, modifying, and editing great stories, therefore
end up jointly creating the greatest of stories. Once cultures become literate
(something that has happened only recently, from the historical
perspective), those stories can be written down. It is at this point, roughly,
that myth and ritual might be said to transform themselves into religion.
The imitation and communication of the greatest, most memorable acts
necessitates distillation and communication of the patterns of the deepest
wisdom of mankind. If a great and memorable act is one undertaken by a
particularly admirable individual, a local hero, then the greatest and most
memorable acts possible would be those undertaken by the spirit (embodied
in part by particular individuals) who exemplified what all local heroes
everywhere have in common. That hero of heroes—that meta-hero—would
have to exist, logically, in turn, in a place that was common across all
places requiring heroism. That place might be regarded as a meta-world—
even though it is real, even hyperreal (that is, more real in its abstraction
across places than our direct perceptions of a given, singular time or place).
It is precisely this hyperreal meta-world that consists of the continual
interactions between chaos and order, which eternally serve as the
battleground between good and evil characterizing the hero. The undying
pattern that hero embodies, in turn—upon whose actions the individual and
society both depend—is the highest of all Gods. He is both child of and
mediator between those twin forces, transforming chaos into habitable order
(as well as recasting order into chaos, so that it can be renewed, when it has
become anachronistic and corrupt), as well as battling mightily so that good
might prevail.
Everyone requires a story to structure their perceptions and actions in
what would otherwise be the overwhelming chaos of being. Every story
requires a starting place that is not good enough and an ending place that is
better. Nothing can be judged in the absence of that end place, that higher
value. Without it, everything sinks into meaninglessness and boredom or
degenerates and spirals into terror, anxiety, and pain. But, as time changes
all things inexorably, every specific, value-predicated story may fail, in its
particular incarnation and locale, and need replacement by something
newer, more complete, but different. In consequence, the actor of a given
story (and, therefore, someone deeply affiliated with the plot and the
characterization) still must bow to the spirit of creative transformation that
originally created and may need to destroy and re-create that story. It is for
this reason that spirit eternally transcends dogma, truth transcends
presupposition, Marduk transcends the elder gods, creativity updates
society, and Christ transcends the law (as does Harry Potter, along with his
courageous but continually rule-breaking friends). But it is important to
remember, as we discussed in Rule I: Those who break the rules ethically
are those who have mastered them first and disciplined themselves to
understand the necessity of those rules, and break them in keeping with the
spirit rather than the letter of the law.
The second volume of Rowling’s series proposes that predatory evil can
be overcome by the soul willing to die and be reborn. The complete series
ends with a creatively transformed repetition of the same message. The
analogy with Christianity is obvious, and the message, in essence, the same:
The soul willing to transform, as deeply as necessary, is the most effective
enemy of the demonic serpents of ideology and totalitarianism, in their
personal and social forms. The healthy, dynamic, and above all else truthful
personality will admit to error. It will voluntarily shed—let die—outdated
perceptions, thoughts, and habits, as impediments to its further success and
growth. This is the soul that will let its old beliefs burn away, often
painfully, so that it can live again, and move forward, renewed. This is also
the soul that will transmit what it has learned during that process of death
and rebirth, so that others can be reborn along with it.
Aim at something. Pick the best target you can currently conceptualize.
Stumble toward it. Notice your errors and misconceptions along the way,
face them, and correct them. Get your story straight. Past, present, future—
they all matter. You need to map your path. You need to know where you
were, so that you do not repeat the mistakes of the past. You need to know
where you are, or you will not be able to draw a line from your starting
point to your destination. You need to know where you are going, or you
will drown in uncertainty, unpredictability, and chaos, and starve for hope
and inspiration. For better or worse, you are on a journey. You are having an
adventure—and your map better be accurate. Voluntarily confront what
stands in your way. The way—that is the path of life, the meaningful path
of life, the straight and narrow path that constitutes the very border between
order and chaos, and the traversing of which brings them into balance.
Aim at something profound and noble and lofty. If you can find a better
path along the way, once you have started moving forward, then switch
course. Be careful, though; it is not easy to discriminate between changing
paths and simply giving up. (One hint: if the new path you see forward,
after learning what you needed to learn along your current way, appears
more challenging, then you can be reasonably sure that you are not deluding
or betraying yourself when you change your mind.) In this manner, you will
zigzag forward. It is not the most efficient way to travel, but there is no real
alternative, given that your goals will inevitably change while you pursue
them, as you learn what you need to learn while you are disciplining
yourself.
You will then find yourself turning across time, incrementally and
gracefully, to aim ever more accurately at that tiny pinpoint, the X that
marks the spot, the bull’s-eye, and the center of the cross; to aim at the
highest value of which you can conceive. You will pursue a target that is
both moving and receding: moving, because you do not have the wisdom to
aim in the proper direction when you first take aim; receding, because no
matter how close you come to perfecting what you are currently practicing,
new vistas of possible perfection will open up in front of you. Discipline
and transformation will nonetheless lead you inexorably forward. With will
and luck, you will find a story that is meaningful and productive, improves
itself with time, and perhaps even provides you with more than a few
moments of satisfaction and joy. With will and luck, you will be the hero of
that story, the disciplined sojourner, the creative transformer, and the
benefactor of your family and broader society.
Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.

I love my father-in-law. I respect him, too. He is extremely stable
emotionally—one of those tough or fortunate people (perhaps a little of
both) who can let the trials and tribulations of life roll off him and keep
moving forward with little complaint and plenty of competence. He is an
old guy now, Dell Roberts—eighty-eight. He has had a knee replaced, and
is planning to get the remaining one done. He has had stents inserted into
his coronary arteries and a heart valve replaced. He suffers from drop foot
and sometimes slips and falls because of it. But he was still curling a year
ago, pushing the heavy granite rock down the ice with a stick specifically
designed for people who can no longer crouch down as easily as they once
could.
When his wife, Beth, now deceased, developed dementia at a relatively
young age, he took care of her in as uncomplaining and unresentful a
manner as anyone could imagine. It was impressive. I am by no means
convinced that I could have fared as well. He cared for her right to the point
where it became impossible for him to lift her out of whatever chair she had
settled into. This was long after she had lost the ability to speak. But it was
obvious by the way her eyes lit up when he entered the room that she still
loved him—and the feeling was mutual. I would not describe him as
someone who is prone to avoidance when the going gets tough. Quite the
contrary.
When Dell was a much younger man, he was for several decades a real
estate dealer in Fairview, Alberta—the small town where I grew up (we
lived right across the street from the Roberts family, in fact). During that
time, he habitually went home for lunch, in accordance with the general
custom. Beth typically prepared him soup (probably Campbell’s, which
everyone ate at that time—“M’m! M’m! Good!”), and a sandwich. One day,
without warning, he snapped at his wife: “Why in the world do we always
eat off these tiny plates? I hate eating off these tiny plates!”
She had been serving the sandwiches on bread-and-butter plates, which
average about six or seven inches in diameter, instead of full-size dinner
plates of ten to twelve inches. She related this story to her daughters, soon
after, in a state of mild shock. This story has been retold to much laughter at
family gatherings many times since. After all, she had been serving him
lunch on those plates for at least twenty years by the time he finally said
anything. She had no idea that he was annoyed by her table settings. He had
never objected. And there is something inexhaustibly amusing about that.
Now, it is possible that he was irritated by something else altogether that
day and did not really care about the plates. And in one sense, it is a trivial
issue. But seen another way, it is not trivial at all, for two reasons. First, if
something happens every day, it is important, and lunch was happening
every day. In consequence, if there was something about it that was
chronically bothersome, even in a minor sort of way, it needed to be
attended to. Second, it is very common to allow so-called minor irritations
(which are not minor, as I said, if they happen constantly) to continue for
years without comment or resolution.
Here is the problem: Collect a hundred, or a thousand, of those, and your
life is miserable and your marriage doomed. Do not pretend you are happy
with something if you are not, and if a reasonable solution might, in
principle, be negotiated. Have the damn fight. Unpleasant as that might be
in the moment, it is one less straw on the camel’s back. And that is
particularly true for those daily events that everyone is prone to regard as
trivial—even the plates on which you eat your lunch. Life is what repeats,
and it is worth getting what repeats right.

Here is a more serious story of the same type. I had a client who had come
to see me about her plans to move to private practice after many years as an
accountant with a large corporation. She was well respected in her
profession, and was a competent, kind, and careful person. But she was also
very unhappy. I presumed initially that her unhappiness stemmed from
anxiety about her career transition. But she managed that move without a
hitch during the time we continued our sessions, while other issues rose to
the forefront.
Her problem was not her career change. It was her marriage. She
described her husband as extraordinarily self-centered and simultaneously
overly concerned with how he appeared in the eyes of others. It was a
contradictory combination, in some manner, although it is common enough
to see this touching of opposites in a personality: If you lean too far in one
direction, something else in you leans equally far in the other. So, despite
the husband’s narcissism (at least from his wife’s perspective), he was in
thrall to the opinions of everyone he met—excepting the members of his
own family. He also drank too much—a habit which exaggerated his
temperamental defects.
My client was not comfortable in her own home. She did not feel there
was anything truly of her within the apartment she shared with her husband
(the couple had no children). Her situation provided a good example of how
what is outside can profoundly reflect what is inside (which is why I
suggest to people who are in psychological trouble that they might begin
their recovery by cleaning up—and then beautifying, if possible—their
rooms). All their household furnishings, which she described as showy,
ornate, and uncomfortable, had been chosen by her husband. Furthermore,
he avidly collected 1960s and 70s pop art, and the walls of the house were
crowded with these items, which he had spent time seeking out in galleries
and otherwise gathering for many years, often while she sat waiting outside
in the car.
She told me that she did not care about the furnishings and the excess of
decorative objects, but that was not really true. What was true was that she
did not care for them—not a bit. Neither the showiness nor the furnishings
nor the plethora of art works that made up her husband’s collection
appealed to her taste. She tended toward a minimalist aesthetic (or perhaps
that preference was a consequence of her husband’s decorative excesses). It
was never quite clear what she might have preferred, and perhaps that was
part of the problem: because she did not know what she liked (and was
equally vague about her dislikes), she was not in the strongest position to
put forward her own opinions. It is difficult to win an argument, or even
begin one, if you have not carefully articulated what you want (or do not)
and need (or do not).
However, she certainly did not enjoy feeling like a stranger in her own
home. For that reason, she never had friends over to visit, which was also a
nontrivial problem, contributing as it did to her feelings of isolation. But the
furnishings and paintings continued to accrue, one shopping expedition at a
time, in Canada and abroad, and with each purchase there was less of her in
the house and in the marriage, and increasingly more of her husband.
Nonetheless, my client never went to war. She never had a fit of anger. She
never put her fist through a particularly objectionable canvas hanging on the
living room wall. In all the decades of her married life, she never had an
outburst of genuine rage; she never directly and conclusively confronted the
fact that she hated her home and her subordination to her husband’s taste.
Instead, she let him have his way, repeatedly, increment by increment,
because she claimed that such trivialities were not worth fighting for. And
with each defeat, the next disagreement became more necessary—although
less likely, because she understood that a serious discussion, once initiated,
risked expanding to include all the things that were troublesome about her
marriage, and that a real, no-holds-barred battle would therefore likely
ensue. Then everything wrong might spill out and have to be faced and
dealt with, by one means or another. So, she kept silent. But she was
chronically repressed and constantly resentful, and felt that she had wasted
much of the opportunity of her life.
It is a mistake to consider the furnishings and the pop art paintings as
simple material objects. They were more truly and importantly containers of
information, so to speak, about the state of the marriage, and were certainly
experienced as such by my client. Every single object of art was the
concrete realization of a victory (Pyrrhic though it may have been) and a
defeat (or, at least, a negotiation that did not occur and, therefore, a fight
that was over before it started). And there were dozens or perhaps hundreds
of these: each a weapon in an unspoken, destructive, and decades-long war.
Unsurprisingly, given the circumstances, the couple split up—after thirty
years of marriage. I believe the husband retained all the furniture and art.
Here is a thought, a terrifying and dispiriting thought, to motivate
improvement in your marriage—to scare you into the appalling difficulties
of true negotiation. Every little problem you have every morning, afternoon,
or evening with your spouse will be repeated for each of the fifteen
thousand days that will make up a forty-year marriage. Every trivial but
chronic disagreement about cooking, dishes, housecleaning, responsibility
for finances, or frequency of intimate contact will be duplicated, over and
over, unless you successfully address it. Perhaps you think (moment to
moment, at least) that it is best to avoid confrontation and drift along in
apparent but false peace. Make no mistake about it, however: you age as
you drift, just as rapidly as you age as you strive. But you have no direction
when you drift, and the probability that you will obtain what you need and
want by drifting aimlessly is very low. Things fall apart of their own accord,
but the sins of men speed their deterioration: that is wisdom from the ages.
It may well be that conscious apprehension of the horror of the same small
hell forever repeated is precisely what is necessary to force you to confront
the problems in your marriage and negotiate in good and desperate faith to
solve them. However, it is the easiest of matters, particularly in the short
term, to ignore the prick of conscience and let the small defeats slide, day
after day. This is not a good strategy. Only careful aim and wakeful striving
and commitment can eliminate the oft-incremental calamity of willful
blindness, stem the entropic tide, and keep catastrophe—familial and social
alike—at bay.

Corruption of the form we are discussing is, in my opinion, integrally
linked to deception—to lying, more bluntly—and more important, to selfdeception. Now, strict logicians regard self-deception as an impossibility.
They cannot understand how it is possible for a person to believe one thing
and its opposite simultaneously. Logicians are not psychologists, however
—and they obviously do not notice, or else fail to take into account, the fact
that they themselves have family members, for example, for whom they at
least occasionally feel love and hate at the same time. Furthermore, it is not
obvious what “believe” means when discussing human belief, nor what is
meant by “simultaneously.” I can believe one thing today and another
tomorrow and very often get away with it, at least in the short term. And on
many occasions I have experienced what was very nearly simultaneous
belief in one thing and its opposite while reading undergraduate university
papers, in which the writer made a claim in one paragraph and a completely
contradictory claim in the next. (Sometimes that happened within the span
of a single sentence.)
There are many conditions or circumstances under which self-deception
can theoretically occur. Psychoanalysts have explored many of these, with
Freud leading the way. Freud believed that much of mental illness was due
to repression, which is arguably and reasonably considered a form of selfdeception. For him, memories of traumatically troubling events were
unconsciously banished to perdition in the unconscious, where they rattled
around and caused trouble, like poltergeists in a dungeon. Freud understood
that the human personality was not unitary. Instead, it consists of a loose,
fragmented cacophony of spirits, who do not always agree or even
communicate. The truth of this claim is self-evident, at least in one simple
manner: we can think about things—we can simulate potential or
alternative actions or events—without immediately having to act them out.
Dissociation of thought and action is necessary for abstract thought even to
exist. Thus, we can clearly think or say one thing and do another. This is
fine when merely thinking, prior to acting, but perhaps not so good when
we promise or claim to believe something and then act in a manner
indicating that we truly have faith in something else. This is a form of
deception, a disjunction in character, a contradiction between modes of
being. It has even been named: to claim one belief and then to act (or speak)
in a different or even opposite manner constitutes a performative
contradiction, according to certain modern philosophers:1
 an implicit lie, in
my opinion. The holding of contradictory beliefs also becomes a problem
when the holder attempts to act out both simultaneously and discovers,
often to his or her great chagrin, the paradox that makes such an attempt
impossible.
Freud catalogued an extensive list of phenomena akin to repression—the
active rejection of potentially conscious psychological material from
awareness—which he termed “defense mechanisms.” These include denial
(“the truth is not so bad”), reaction formation (“I really, really, really love
my mother”), displacement (“the boss yells at me, I yell at my wife, my
wife yells at the baby, the baby bites the cat”), identification (“I am bullied,
so I am motivated to be a bully”), rationalization (a self-serving explanation
for a low-quality action), intellectualization (a favorite of the early, funny,
neurotic Woody Allen), sublimation (“I can always paint nude women”),
and projection (“I am not touchy; you are just annoying”). Freud was an
outstanding philosopher of deceit. He was not afraid to point out the
relationship between dishonesty and psychopathology. Nonetheless, his
ideas of self-deception suffer, in my opinion, from two major errors.
First error: Freud failed to notice that sins of omission contributed to
mental illness as much as, or more than, the sins of commission, listed
above, that constitute repression. In doing so, he merely thought in the
typical manner. People generally believe that actively doing something bad
(that is the sin of commission) is, on average, worse than passively not
doing something good (that is the sin of omission). Perhaps this is because
there are always good things we are not doing; some sins of omission are
therefore inevitable. In any case, there are still times when willful blindness
nonetheless produces more serious catastrophes, more easily rationalized
away, than the active or the unconscious repression of something terrible
but understood (the latter being a sin of commission, because it is known).
The former problem—willful blindness—occurs when you could come to
know something but cease exploring so that you fail to discover something
that might cause you substantial discomfort. Spin doctors call this selfimposed ignorance “plausible deniability,” which is a phrase that indicates
intellectualized rationalization of the most pathological order. It should be
noted that such blindness is often regarded as an outright crime. If you are a
CEO, for example, and you suspect that your treasurer is cooking the books,
and you do not investigate because you do not want to know, you may still
be liable for your inaction—as is appropriate. Failing to look under the bed
when you strongly suspect a monster is lurking there is not an advisable
strategy.
Second error: Freud assumed that things experienced are things
understood. In accordance with that assumption, he believed that a memory
trace existed, somewhere in the mind, that accurately represented the past,
like an objective video recording. These would be reasonable presumptions,
if our experience was simply a series of objectively real and self-evident
events transmitted through our senses, thought about, evaluated, and then
acted upon. If this was all true, traumatic experience would be accurately
represented in memory, even when pushed out of awareness by unconscious
mechanisms (or conscious—but Freud presumed the former) because of its
understood but terrible nature. However, neither reality nor our processing
of reality is as objective or articulated as Freud presupposed.
Imagine, for example, that you have been ignored, romantically—more
than you can tolerate—for several months by your wife or husband. Then
you encounter him or her leaning over the fence, talking in a friendly
manner (and perhaps no more than that) to an attractive neighbor. How we
process such anomalous, novel, troublesome, or even traumatic experience
is very rarely a matter of perception, followed by conscious understanding
and thought, then emotion or motivation derived from that thought, then
action. What happens instead is akin to what we discussed at length in Rule
I and Rule II: We process the unknown world from the bottom up. We
encounter containers of information, so to speak, whose full import is by no
means self-evident. Upon witnessing your spouse talking to the neighbor,
therefore, it is not as if you think, in an altogether articulated and fully
developed philosophical form: “I have been lonesome and deprived
physically for months by my spouse. Although I have not said anything in
detail, this has caused me constant frustration and pain. Now he (or she) is
rubbing it in, as far as I am concerned, by being so outgoing with a
comparative stranger when I have experienced so little attention.” It is
much more likely that anger, grief, and loneliness have accumulated within
you with each rejection, bit by bit, until you are filled to the brim—and,
now, overflowing.
That sudden appearance of negative emotion does not necessarily mean
that you are even now fully conscious of its accumulation. You may well
(as in the case of my father-in-law, or my client) have experienced the
frustration build up gradually enough so that you found yourself more
irritable and unhappy, but that does not necessarily mean that you noticed
the cause. And what is the cause? The range of possibilities is
uncomfortably broad. Perhaps you are not being ignored at all. Instead, you
have been having trouble at work, and that has produced a decrease in your
overall confidence. In consequence, you have become sensitized to any
signs of rejection, even imaginary, within your marriage. So, what you must
determine is not so much why your wife or husband is no longer attentive to
you, but what it is about your boss, colleagues, or career that is
destabilizing you. That puts the true cause of your discomfort a long
distance away from the symptoms (the feelings of rejection) that are making
you irritable, sensitive, and hurt. There is nothing obvious about the
relationship between cause and effect in such cases. Perhaps you really are
being ignored, just as you suspect. Perhaps it is a sign of an impending
affair and a manifestation of the trajectory that leads to divorce. Both of
those, if true, are serious problems. It is no wonder you are upset. But you
may remain stubbornly unwilling to consider that your career or marriage is
in trouble. And that is no surprise. But it is not helpful.
On top of all that is the general complexity of life, complicating the
search for clarity. Consider the question “What really happened?” say, in a
failed marriage, divorce, and child-custody battle. The answer to that query
is so complex that settling the disagreements frequently requires court
evaluation and multi-party assessment. Even then, one or even both of the
protagonists is unlikely to believe that the truth has been served. This is
partly because events in general and interpersonal events specifically do not
exist as simple, objective facts, independent of one another. Everything
depends for its meaning—for the information it truly represents—on the
context in which it is embedded, much of which is not available for
perception or consideration when the event in question occurs. The meaning
of what someone’s wife says to him today is dependent on everything both
have ever said to each other, everything they have ever done together, and
the contents of their mutual imaginations—and that does not exhaust the
complexity. Such meaning may even be importantly dependent on how, for
example, the wife’s mother treated her father (or her grandmother treated
her grandfather), as well as the relationship between men and women in the
broader culture. That is why domestic arguments so often spiral out of
control, particularly when a pattern of continual and effective
communication has never been established. One thing leads to a deeper
thing, and that leads deeper yet, until an argument that started over what
size plates are best used at lunchtime turns into a no-holds-barred war about
whether the marriage in question would be better dissolved. And there is
certainly fear of falling down a hole of that size (again, particularly when
much has remained unspoken) that motivates the proclivity to keep things
to yourself when they would be better, but dangerously, said.

Imagine that you are afraid. You have reason to be. You are afraid of
yourself. You are afraid of other people. You are afraid of the world. You
are nostalgic for the innocence of the past; for the time before you learned
the terrible things that shattered the trust characterizing your childhood. The
knowledge you have gained of yourself, other people, and the world has
embittered more than enlightened. You have been betrayed, hurt, and
disappointed. You have become distrustful even of hope itself, as your hope
has been repeatedly shattered (and that is the very definition of
hopelessness). The last thing you want is to know more. Better to leave
what is enshrouded in mystery. Better, as well, to avoid thinking too much
(or at all) about what could be. When ignorance is bliss, after all, ’tis folly
to be wise.
Imagine, more precisely, that you are so afraid that you will not allow
yourself even to know what you want. Knowing would simultaneously
mean hoping, and your hopes have been dashed. You have your reasons for
maintaining your ignorance. You are afraid, perhaps, that there is nothing
worth wanting; you are afraid that if you specify what you want precisely
you will simultaneously discover (and all too clearly) what constitutes
failure; you are afraid that failure is the most likely outcome; and, finally,
you are afraid that if you define failure and then fail, you will know beyond
a shadow of a doubt that it was you that failed, and that it was your fault.
So, you do not allow yourself to know what you want. You manage this
by refusing to think it through. You are happy, satisfied, and engaged
sometimes and unhappy, frustrated, and nihilistic other times, but you will
not enquire deeply into why, because then you would know, and then you
would encounter yet-again shattered hope and confirmed disappointment.
You are also afraid, but for different reasons, to allow others to know what
you want. First, if they were to find out just what you wanted, then they
might tell you, and then you would know, even if you were fighting against
gathering that very knowledge. Second, if they knew, they could then deny
you what you truly wanted, even needed, and hurt you much more
efficiently than they might if your deepest desires (and, therefore, your
vulnerabilities) remained secret.
The fog that hides is the refusal to notice—to attend to—emotions and
motivational states as they arise, and the refusal to communicate them both
to yourself and to the people who are close to you. A bad mood signifies
something. A state of anxiety or sadness signifies something, and not likely
something that will please you to discover. The most probable outcome of
successfully articulating an emotion that has accrued without expression
over time is tears—an admission of vulnerability and pain (which are also
feelings that people do not like to allow, particularly when they are feeling
distrustful and angry). Who wants to dig down into the depths of pain and
grief and guilt until the tears emerge? And voluntary refusal to take notice
of our emotional states is not the only impediment to dealing with them. If
your wife or husband (or whomever else you are tangled up with,
unhappily, at the moment) says something that comes too close to the
painful truth, for example, then a sharp and insulting remark will often shut
them up—and is therefore very likely to be offered. This is partly a test:
does the person being insulted care enough about you and your suffering to
dig past a few obstacles and unearth the bitter truth? It is also partly, and
more obviously, defensive: if you can chase someone away from something
you yourself do not want to discover, that makes your life easier in the
present. Sadly, it is also very disappointing if that defense succeeds, and is
typically accompanied by a sense of abandonment, loneliness, and selfbetrayal. You must nonetheless still live among other people, and they with
you. And you have desires, wants, and needs, however unstated and
unclear. And you are still motivated to pursue them, not least because it is
impossible to live without desire, want, and need.Your strategy, under such
conditions? Show your disappointment whenever someone close to you
makes you unhappy; allow yourself the luxury and pleasure of resentment
when something does not go your way; ensure that the person who has
transgressed against you is frozen out by your disapproval; force them to
discover with as much difficulty as possible exactly what they have done to
disappoint you; and, finally, let them grope around blindly in the fog that
you have generated around yourself until they stumble into and injure
themselves on the sharp hidden edges of your unrevealed preferences and
dreams. And maybe these responses are tests, too—tests deeply associated
with the lack of courage to trust: “If you really loved me, you would brave
the terrible landscape that I have arrayed around myself to discover the real
me.” And perhaps there is even something to such claims, implicit though
they may be. A certain testing of commitment might have its utility.
Everything does not have to be given away for free. But even a little
unnecessary mystery goes a long way.
And you still must live with yourself. In the short term, perhaps you are
protected from the revelation of your insufficiency by your refusal to make
yourself clear. Every ideal is a judge, after all: the judge who says, “You are
not manifesting your true potential.” No ideals? No judge. But the price
paid for that is purposelessness. This is a high price. No purpose? Then, no
positive emotion, as most of what drives us forward with hope intact is the
experience of approaching something we deeply need and want. And worse,
when we are without purpose: chronic, overwhelming anxiety, as focused
purpose constrains what is otherwise likely to be the intolerable chaos of
unexploited possibility and too much choice.
If you make what you want clear and commit yourself to its pursuit, you
may fail. But if you do not make what you want clear, then you will
certainly fail. You cannot hit a target that you refuse to see. You cannot hit a
target if you do not take aim. And, equally dangerously, in both cases: you
will not accrue the advantage of aiming, but missing. You will not benefit
from the learning that inevitably takes place when things do not go your
way. Success at a given endeavor often means trying, falling short,
recalibrating (with the new knowledge generated painfully by the failure),
and then trying again and falling short—often repeated, ad nauseam.
Sometimes all that learning, impossible without the failure, leads you to see
that aiming your ambition in a different direction would be better (not
because it is easier; not because you have given up; not because you are
avoiding—but because you have learned through the vicissitudes of your
experience that what you seek is not to be found where you were looking,
or is simply not attainable in the manner by which you chose to pursue it).
So, what might you do—what should you do—as an alternative to hiding
things in the fog? Admit to your feelings. This is a very tricky matter (and it
does not simply mean “give in” to them). First, noting, much less
communicating, feelings of (petty) anger or pain due to lonesomeness, or
anxiety about something that might be trivial, or jealousy that is likely
unwarranted is embarrassing. The admission of such feelings is a revelation
of ignorance, insufficiency, and vulnerability. Second, it is unsettling to
allow for the possibility that your feelings, however overwhelming and
convincing, might be misplaced and, in your ignorance, pointing you in the
wrong direction. It is possible that you have misinterpreted the situation
entirely, for reasons of which you remain fundamentally unconscious. It is
for such reasons that trust is vital: but trust of the mature and tragic sort. A
naive person trusts because he or she believes that people are essentially or
even universally trustworthy. But any person who has truly lived has been
—or has—betrayed.
Someone with experience knows that people are capable of deception
and willing to deceive. That knowledge brings with it an arguably justified
pessimism about human nature, personal and otherwise, but it also opens
the door to another kind of faith in humanity: one based on courage, rather
than naivete. I will trust you—I will extend my hand to you—despite the
risk of betrayal, because it is possible, through trust, to bring out the best in
you, and perhaps in me. So, I will accept substantial risk to open the door to
cooperation and negotiation. And even if you do betray me, in a not-too
unforgivable manner (assuming a certain degree, shall we say, of genuine
apology and contrition on your part), I will continue to extend my hand.
And part of the way I will do that is by telling you what I am feeling.
A certain necessary humility must accompany such raw revelations. I
should not say—at least not ideally—“You have been ignoring me lately.” I
should say, instead, “I feel isolated and lonely and hurt, and cannot help but
feel that you have not been as attentive to me over the last few months as I
would have liked or that might have been best for us as a couple. But I am
unsure if I am just imagining all this because I am upset or if I am
genuinely seeing what is going on.” The latter statement gets the point
across, but avoids the accusatory stance that so often serves as the first
defense against a serious, get-to-the-bottom-of-things conversation. And it
is very possible that you are wrong about just what is causing you to feel
the way you do. If you are, you need to know it, because there is no point in
propagating errors that are causing you and others pain and interfering with
your future. Best to find out what is true—best to disperse the fog—and
find out if the sharp objects you feared were lurking there are real or
fantastical. And there is always the danger that some of them are real. But it
is better to see them than to keep them occluded by the fog, because you
can at least sometimes avoid the danger that you are willing to see.

Events, as they lay themselves out in front of us, do not simply inform us of
why they occur, and we do not remember the past in order to objectively
record bounded, well-defined events and situations. The latter act is
impossible, in any case. The information in our experience is latent, like
gold in ore—the case we made in Rule II. It must be extracted and refined
with great effort, and often in collaboration with other people, before it can
be employed to improve the present and the future. We use our past
effectively when it helps us repeat desirable—and avoid repeating
undesirable—experiences. We want to know what happened but, more
importantly, we want to know why. Why is wisdom. Why enables us to
avoid making the same mistake again and again, and if we are fortunate
helps us repeat our successes.
Extracting useful information from experience is difficult. It requires the
purest of motivations (“things should be made better, not worse”) to
perform it properly. It requires the willingness to confront error,
forthrightly, and to determine at what point and why departure from the
proper path occurred. It requires the willingness to change, which is almost
always indistinguishable from the decision to leave something (or someone,
or some idea) behind. Therefore, the simplest response imaginable is to
look away and refuse to think, while simultaneously erecting
unsurmountable impediments to genuine communication.
Unfortunately, in the longer term, this willful blindness leaves life murky
and foggy; leaves it void, unseen, without form, confused—and leaves you
bewildered and astonished.2
 This is all a strange concatenation of the
psychological and the real, the subjective and the objective. Is something
frightening, or am I afraid? Is something beautiful, or am I imposing the
idea of beauty upon it? When I become angry with someone, is it because
of something they have done, or my lack of control? Such questions define
the state of confusion you occupy chronically when the bottom has fallen
out of your world. That state can have an objective element, because a fall
is often caused by something real, such as a death, a serious illness, or a
bout of unemployment; but it is also subjective, associated with a state
composed of pain, doubt, confusion, and the inability to choose—or even
perceive—a path forward.
The ground of Being is subject and object simultaneously—motivation,
emotion, and material thing all at once—before perception is clarified,
before the world is articulated. The wife remains uncomprehended. The
context of her speech remains unexplored, for fear of what that exploration
might reveal. The situation cannot be described because the word is left
vague and unformed. Our own personal motivations begin in hidden form,
and remain that way, because we do not want to know what we are up to.
The wheat remains unseparated from the chaff. The gold remains in the
clutches of the dragon, as does the virgin. The philosopher’s stone remains
undiscovered in the gutter; and the information hidden in the round chaos,
beckoning, remains unexplored. Such omission is the voluntary refusal of
expanded consciousness. After all, the pathway to the Holy Grail has its
beginnings in the darkest part of the forest, and what you need remains
hidden where you least want to look.
If you pile up enough junk in your closet, one day, when you are least
prepared, the door will spring open, and all of what has been packed inside,
growing inexorably in the darkness, will bury you, and you may not have
enough time or energy left in your life to confront it, sort through it, keep
what you need, and discard the rest. This is what it means to be crushed
under excess baggage. This is the return of Tiamat, the great Mesopotamian
Goddess of Chaos, destroyer of those who act improperly.
The world is full of hidden dangers and obstacles—and opportunities.
Leaving everything hidden in the fog because you are afraid of the danger
you may find there will be of little help when fate forces you to run
headlong toward what you have refused to see. Impaling yourself on sharp
branches, stumbling over boulders, and rushing by places of sanctuary, you
will finally refuse to admit you could have burned away the haze with the
bright light of your consciousness, had you not hidden it under a bushel.
Then you will come to curse man, reality, and God himself for producing
such an impenetrable maze of impediments and barriers. Corruption will
beckon to you, led as you increasingly will be by dark, unexamined
motivations—bred by failure, amplified by frustration—viciously
culminating in the resentful belief that those who have transgressed against
you are getting from you exactly what they deserve. This attitude and the
actions and inactions it will inevitably produce will impoverish your life,
your community, your nation, and the world. This will in turn impoverish
Being itself (and that will be exactly what your darkest unexamined
motivations desire).
With careful searching, with careful attention, you might tip the balance
toward opportunity and against obstacle sufficiently so that life is clearly
worth living, despite its fragility and suffering. If you truly wanted, perhaps
you would receive, if you asked. If you truly sought, perhaps you would
find what you seek. If you knocked, truly wanting to enter, perhaps the door
would open. But there will be times in your life when it will take everything
you have to face what is in front of you, instead of hiding away from a truth
so terrible that the only thing worse is the falsehood you long to replace it
with.
Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.

In my dual role as clinical psychologist and professor, I have coached many
people in the development of their careers. Sometimes those I am coaching
consult me because their coworkers, subordinates, or bosses will not do
their jobs properly. They are supervised by, working alongside, or managing
people who are narcissistic, incompetent, malevolent, or tyrannical. Such
things happen and must be dealt with in whatever reasonable manner will
bring them to a halt. I do not encourage people to martyr themselves. It is a
bad idea to sacrifice yourself uncomplainingly so that someone else can
take the credit. Nonetheless, under such circumstances—if you are a wise
and attentive person—you might still notice that your unproductive
coworkers are leaving a plethora of valuable tasks undone. You might then
ask yourself, “What would happen if I took responsibility for doing them?”
It is a daunting question. What is left undone is often risky, difficult, and
necessary. But that also means—does it not?—that it is worthwhile and
significant. And you may have the eyes to see that there is a problem,
despite your all-too-frequent blindness. How do you know that it is not,
therefore, your problem? Why do you notice this issue and not some other?
This is a question worth considering in depth.
If you want to become invaluable in a workplace—in any community—
just do the useful things no one else is doing. Arrive earlier and leave later
than your compatriots (but do not deny yourself your life).1
 Organize what
you can see is dangerously disorganized. Work, when you are working,
instead of looking like you are working. And finally, learn more about the
business—or your competitors—than you already know. Doing so will
make you invaluable—a veritable lynchpin. People will notice that and
begin to appreciate your hard-earned merits.
You might object, “Well, I just could not manage to take on something
that important.” What if you began to build yourself into a person who
could? You could start by trying to solve a small problem—something that
is bothering you, that you think you could fix. You could start by
confronting a dragon of just the size that you are likely to defeat. A tiny
serpent might not have had the time to hoard a lot of gold, but there might
still be some treasure to be won, along with a reasonable probability of
succeeding in such a quest (and not too much chance of a fiery or
toothsome death). Under reasonable circumstances, picking up the excess
responsibility is an opportunity to become truly invaluable. And then, if you
want to negotiate for a raise, or more autonomy—or more free time, for that
matter—you can go to your boss and say, “Here are ten things that were
crying out to be done, each of them vital, and I am now doing all of them. If
you help me out a bit, I will continue. I might even improve. And
everything, including your life, will improve along with me.” And then, if
your boss has any sense—and sometimes bosses do—then your negotiation
will be successful. That is how such things work. And do not forget that
there is no shortage of genuinely good people who are thrilled if they can
give someone useful and trustworthy a hand up. It is one of the truly
altruistic pleasures of life, and its depth is not to be underestimated, or to be
disregarded with the cheap cynicism that masks itself as world-weary
wisdom.
It appears that the meaning that most effectively sustains life is to be
found in the adoption of responsibility. When people look back on what
they have accomplished, they think, if they are fortunate: “Well, I did that,
and it was valuable. It was not easy. But it was worth it.” It is a strange and
paradoxical fact that there is a reciprocal relationship between the worth of
something and the difficulty of accomplishing it. Imagine the following
conversation: “Do you want difficulty?” “No, I want ease.” “In your
experience, has doing something easy been worthwhile?” “Well, no, not
very often.” “Then perhaps you really want something difficult.” I think
that is the secret to the reason for Being itself: difficult is necessary.
It is for this reason that we voluntarily and happily place limitations on
ourselves. Every time we play a game, for example, we accept a set of
arbitrary restrictions. We narrow and limit ourselves, and explore the
possibilities thereby revealed. That is what makes the game. But it does not
work without the arbitrary rules. You take them on voluntarily, absurdly, as
in chess: “I can only move this knight in an L. How ridiculous. But how
fun!” Because it is not fun, oddly enough, if you can move any piece
anywhere. It is not a game anymore if you can make any old move at all.
Accept some limitations, however, and the game begins. Accept them, more
broadly speaking, as a necessary part of Being and a desirable part of life.
Assume you can transcend them by accepting them. And then you can play
the limited game properly.
And this is all not merely of psychological import, and it is by no means
just a game. People need meaning, but problems also need solving. It is
very salutary, from the psychological perspective, to find something of
significance—something worth sacrificing for (or to), something worth
confronting and taking on. But the suffering and malevolence that
characterize life are real, with the terrible consequences of the real—and
our ability to solve problems, by confronting them and taking them on, is
also real. By taking responsibility, we can find a meaningful path, improve
our personal lot psychologically, and make what is intolerably wrong
genuinely better. Thus, we can have our cake and eat it, too.

There is a proper way to behave—an ethic—and you are destined to
contend with it. You cannot help but calculate yourself across time, and
everyone else across time, and you are reporting back to yourself,
inevitably, on your own behavior and misbehavior. What works across
multiple time frames and multiple places for multiple people (including
yourself)—that is the goal. It is an emergent ethic, hard to formulate
explicitly, but inescapable in its existence and its consequences, and an
ineradicably deep part of the game of Being. Great players are attractive.
Attractive people attract mates. The closer we match the pattern—the
emergent pattern—the more likely we are to survive and protect our
families. The playing field selects the players on the basis of their ethical
behavior. And we are therefore biologically prepared to respond positively
to and to imitate the Great Player—and to disapprove, even violently, of the
deceiver, the cheat, and the fraud. And it is your conscience—your instinct
for moral virtue—that indicates deviation from the path. When your child
purposefully trips an opponent during a soccer game, or fails to pass to an
open teammate with a great opportunity to score, you frown. You feel
shame, as you should, because you are witnessing the betrayal of someone
you love, by someone you love—and that is your child’s self-betrayal.
Something similar occurs when you violate your own sense of propriety. It
is the same instinct, and it is best attended to. If you do not follow the right
path, you will wander off a cliff and suffer miserably—and there is simply
no way that the most profound parts of yourself are going to allow that
without protest.
You might rationalize: “There is no cliff here now. There is no cliff I can
see nearby. And a cliff I will not tumble off for ten years is a long way
away.” But the part of your psyche that is most profound invariably objects:
“Such thinking is not appropriate. It will not do. What is ten years away is
still real, despite its distance (allowing for unavoidable errors of prediction).
If there is a catastrophe waiting there, we are not going to aim at it now. Not
without objection.” If your behavior suggests that you are tilting in that
direction, then you are going to feel guilty and horrible about it, if you are
lucky and even minimally awake. And thank God for that. If the cost of
betraying yourself, in the deepest sense, is guilt, shame, and anxiety, the
benefit of not betraying yourself is meaning—the meaning that sustains.
That is the most valuable of opportunities that lurks where responsibility
has been abdicated.
If you attend to your conscience, you will begin to determine that some
of the things you are doing are wrong. More precisely: if you are alerted to
the possibility of your own wrongdoing by your conscience, and you then
begin to engage in a true dialogue with that same agent, you will begin to
develop a clear picture of what is wrong—and, by implication, of what is
right. Right is not least the opposite of wrong—and wrong is in some clear
sense more blatant and obvious. A sense of right can therefore be developed
and honed through careful attention to what is wrong. You act and betray
yourself, and you feel bad about that. You do not know exactly why. You try
to avoid thinking about it, because it is less painful and easier in the short
term not to think about it. You try with all your might to ignore it, but all
that does is increase your sense of self-betrayal and further divide you
against yourself.
So, you reconsider, perhaps, and you confront your discomfort. You note
your disunity and the chaos that comes with it. You ask yourself—you pray
to discover—what you did wrong. And the answer arrives. And it is not
what you want. And part of you must therefore die, so that you can change.
And the part that must die struggles for its existence, puts forward its
rationale, and pleads its case. And it will do so with every trick in its
possession—employing the most egregious lies, the bitterest, most
resentment-eliciting memories of the past, and the most hopelessly cynical
attitudes about the future (indeed, about the value of life itself). But you
persevere, and discriminate, judge, and decide exactly why what you did
was wrong, and you start to understand, by contrast, what might have been
right. And then you determine to start acting in accordance with your
conscience. You decide that it is a partner, despite its adversarial form. You
put all that you have discovered to be right into action, and you begin your
ascent. You start to monitor yourself, ever more careful to ensure you are
doing the right thing—listening to what you say, watching yourself act,
trying not to deviate from the straight and narrow path. That becomes your
goal.
An idea begins to take shape: “I am going to live my life properly. I am
going to aim at the good. I am going to aim at the highest good I can
possible manage.” Now, all the parts of you taking care of your future self
are on board. You are all aimed in one direction. You are no longer a house
divided against itself. You are standing solidly on a firm foundation. You
are no longer so easy to dissuade or discourage. Your resolution trumps
your nihilism and despair. The struggle you have had with your own
tendency to doubt and dissimulate protects you against the unwarranted and
cynical criticisms of others. There is a high goal, a mountain peak, a star
that shines in the darkness, beckoning above the horizon. Its mere existence
gives you hope—and that is the meaning without which you cannot live.
Remember Pinocchio? When Geppetto wants to transform the woodenheaded puppet he created into something real, he first raises his eyes above
the horizon and wishes on a star. It is the same star that announces
Pinocchio’s birth at the beginning of the movie and whose light is reflected
in the golden badge granted to Jiminy Cricket at the close. It is the same
star, symbolically speaking, that announces the birth of Christ in the depths
of the darkness. Geppetto focuses on the star and makes a wish. The wish is
that his marionette with strings controlled by someone or something else
will become real. The story of the puppet and his temptations and trials is a
psychological drama. We all understand it, even though we cannot
necessarily articulate that understanding. It is necessary to lift your eyes
above the horizon, to establish a transcendent goal, if you wish to cease
being a puppet, under the control of things you do not understand and
perhaps do not want to understand. Then all the subsystems or
subpersonalities that might otherwise be pursing their own limited
fulfillment will join together under the aegis of the truly ideal, and the
consequence of that will be an engagement that approximates the ultimate
or total. Under such conditions, all the parts of you are going to be on
board. That is the psychological equivalent of monotheism. That is the
emergence of the higher self that might be the true servant of God, in
whatever metaphysical reality potentially underlies what is obvious to our
blind and limited mortal selves.
What is the antidote to the suffering and malevolence of life? The
highest possible goal. What is the prerequisite to pursuit of the highest
possible goal? Willingness to adopt the maximum degree of responsibility
—and this includes the responsibilities that others disregard or neglect. You
might object: “Why should I shoulder all that burden? It is nothing but
sacrifice, hardship, and trouble.” But what makes you so sure you do not
want something heavy to carry? You positively need to be occupied with
something weighty, deep, profound, and difficult. Then, when you wake up
in the middle of the night and the doubts crowd in, you have some defense:
“For all my flaws, which are manifold, at least I am doing this. At least I am
taking care of myself. At least I am of use to my family, and to the other
people around me. At least I am moving, stumbling upward, under the load
I have determined to carry.” You can attain some genuine self-respect that
way—but it is not a mere shallow psychological construct that has to do
with how you are construing yourself in the moment. It is far deeper than
that—and it is not only psychological. It is real, as well as psychological.
Your life becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depths of the
responsibility you are willing to shoulder. That is because you are now
genuinely involved in making things better. You are minimizing the
unnecessary suffering. You are encouraging those around you, by example
and word. You are constraining the malevolence in your own heart and the
hearts of others. A bricklayer may question the utility of laying his bricks,
monotonously, one after another. But perhaps he is not merely laying
bricks. Maybe he is building a wall. And the wall is part of a building. And
the building is a cathedral. And the purpose of the cathedral is the
glorification of the Highest Good. And under such circumstances, every
brick laid is an act that partakes of the divine. And if what you are doing in
your day-to-day activity is not enough, then you are not aiming at the
construction of a proper cathedral. And that is because you are not aiming
high enough. Because if you were, then you would experience the sense of
meaning in relationship to your sufficiently high goal, and it would justify
the misery and limitations of your life. If you have something meaningful to
pursue, then you are engrossed in life. You are on a meaningful path. The
most profound and reliable instinct for meaning—if not perverted by selfdeceit and sin (there is no other way to state it)—manifests itself when you
are on the path of maximum virtue.
The sense of meaning is an indicator that you are on that path. It is an
indication that all the complexity that composes you is lined up within you,
and aimed at something worth pursuing—something that balances the
world, something that produces harmony. It is something you hear made
manifest in music, and the profound sense of meaning that music
intrinsically produces. Maybe you are a nihilistic death-metal punk. You are
deeply skeptical and pessimistic. You find meaning nowhere. You hate
everything, just on principle. But then your favorite nihilistic death-metal
punk band lead guitarist and his bandmates start to blast out their patterned
harmonies—each in alignment with the other—and you are caught! “Ah, I
do not believe in anything—but, God, that music!” And the lyrics are
destructive and nihilistic and cynical and bitter and hopeless but it does not
matter, because the music beckons and calls to your spirit, and fills it with
the intimation of meaning, and moves you, so that you align yourself with
the patterns, and you nod your head and tap your feet to the beat,
participating despite yourself. It is those patterns of sound, layered one on
top of another, harmoniously, moving in the same direction, predictably and
unpredictably, in perfect balance: order and chaos, in their eternal dance.
And you dance with it, no matter how scornful you are. You align yourself
with that patterned, directional harmony. And in that you find the meaning
that sustains.
You are possessed of an instinct—a spirit—that orients you toward the
highest good. It calls your soul away from hell and toward heaven. And
because it is there, you find yourself frequently disillusioned. People
disappoint you. You betray yourself; you lose a meaningful connection to
your workplace, boss, or partner. You think, “The world is not set right. It is
deeply troubling to me.” That very disenchantment, however, can serve as
the indicator of destiny. It speaks of abdicated responsibility—of things left
undone, of things that still need to be done. You are irritated about that
need. You are annoyed with the government, you are embittered and
resentful about your job, you are unhappy with your parents, and you are
frustrated with all these people around you who will not take on
responsibility. There are, after all, things that are crying out to be
accomplished. You are outraged that what needs to be done is not being
done. That anger—that outrage—is, however, a doorway. That observation
of abdicated responsibility is the indication of destiny and meaning. The
part of you that is oriented toward the highest good is pointing out the
disjunction between the ideal you can imagine—the ideal that is possessing
you—and the reality you are experiencing. There is a gap there, and it is
communicating its need to be filled. You can give way to fury, in
consequence, and blame it on someone else—and it is not as if other people
are not contributing to the problems. Or you can come to understand that
your very disappointment is an indication to you from the most fundamental
levels of your being that there is something wrong that needs to be set right
—and, perhaps, by you. What is it, that concern, that care, that irritation,
that distraction? It is not the call to happiness. It is the call to the action and
adventure that make up a real life. Consider, once again, the biblical story
of Abraham. God comes to Abraham, and says,
Go from your country, your people and your father’s household
to the land I will show you.
I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will
make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I
will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.
(Genesis 12:1–3)
That late bloomer Abraham has been hanging around his father’s tent for
far too many years, to put it mildly. But if God’s call comes, it is better to
heed it, no matter how late (and in that, there is real hope, for those who
believe that they have delayed too long). Abraham leaves his country, and
his people, and his father’s household, and journeys out into the world,
following the still small voice; following God’s call. And it is no call to
happiness. It is the complete bloody catastrophe we previously described:
famine, war, and domestic strife. All this might make the reasonable
individual (not to mention Abraham himself) doubt the wisdom of listening
to God and conscience, and of adopting the responsibility of autonomy and
the burden of adventure. Better to be lying in a hammock, devouring peeled
grapes in the security of Dad’s tent. What calls you out into the world,
however—to your destiny—is not ease. It is struggle and strife. It is bitter
contention and the deadly play of the opposites. It is probable—inevitable
—that the adventure of your life will frustrate and disappoint and unsettle
you, as you heed the call of conscience and shoulder your responsibility and
endeavor to set yourself and the world right. But that is where the deep
meaning that orients you and shelters you is to be found. That is where
things will line up for you; where things that have been scattered apart and
broken will come together; where purpose will manifest itself; where what
is proper and good will be supported and what is weak and resentful and
arrogant and destructive will be defeated. That is where the life that is
worth living is to be eternally found—and where you can find it, personally,
if only you are willing.
Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.

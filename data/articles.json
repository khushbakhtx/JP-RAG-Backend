            "content": "\nFor years, I saw a client who lived by himself.* He was isolated in many\nother ways in addition to his living situation. He had extremely limited\nfamily ties. Both of his daughters had moved out of the country, and did not\nmaintain much contact, and he had no other relatives except a father and\nsister from whom he was estranged. His wife and the mother of his children\nhad passed away years ago, and the sole relationship he endeavored to\nestablish while he saw me over the course of more than a decade and a half\nterminated tragically when his new partner was killed in an automobile\naccident.\nWhen we began to work together, our conversations were decidedly\nawkward. He was not accustomed to the subtleties of social interaction, so\nhis behaviors, verbal and nonverbal, lacked the dance-like rhythm and\nharmony that characterize the socially fluent. As a child, he had been\nthoroughly ignored as well as actively discouraged by both parents. His\nfather\u2014mostly absent\u2014was neglectful and sadistic in his inclinations,\nwhile his mother was chronically alcoholic. He had also been consistently\ntormented and harassed at school, and had not chanced upon a teacher in all\nhis years of education who paid him any genuine attention. These\nexperiences left my client with a proclivity toward depression, or at least\nworsened what might have been a biological tendency in that direction. He\nwas, in consequence, abrupt, irritable, and somewhat volatile if he felt\nmisunderstood or was unexpectedly interrupted during a conversation. Such\nreactions helped ensure that his targeting by bullies continued into his adult\nlife, particularly in his place of work.\nI soon noticed, however, that things worked out quite well during our\nsessions if I kept mostly quiet. He would drop in, weekly or biweekly, and\ntalk about what had befallen and preoccupied him during the previous seven\nto fourteen days. If I maintained silence for the first fifty minutes of our\none-hour sessions, listening intently, then we could converse, in a relatively\nnormal, reciprocal manner, for the remaining ten minutes. This pattern\ncontinued for more than a decade, as I learned, increasingly, to hold my\ntongue (something that does not come easily to me). As the years passed,\nhowever, I noticed that the proportion of time he spent discussing negative\nissues with me decreased. Our conversation\u2014his monologue, really\u2014had\nalways started with what was bothering him, and rarely progressed past\nthat. But he worked hard outside our sessions, cultivating friends, attending\nartistic gatherings and music festivals, and resurrecting a long-dormant\ntalent for composing songs and playing the guitar. As he became more\nsocial, he began to generate solutions to the problems he communicated to\nme, and to discuss, in the latter portion of the hours we shared, some of the\nmore positive aspects of his existence. It was slow going, but he made\ncontinual incremental progress. When he first came to see me, we could not\nsit together at a table in a coffee shop\u2014or, indeed, in any public space\u2014and\npractice anything resembling a real-world conversation without his being\nparalyzed into absolute silence. By the time we finished, he was reading his\noriginal poetry in front of small groups, and had even tried his hand at\nstand-up comedy.\nHe was the best personal and practical exemplar of something I had\ncome to realize over my more than twenty years of psychological practice:\npeople depend on constant communication with others to keep their minds\norganized. We all need to think to keep things straight, but we mostly think\nby talking. We need to talk about the past, so we can distinguish the trivial,\noverblown concerns that otherwise plague our thoughts from the\nexperiences that are truly important. We need to talk about the nature of the\npresent and our plans for the future, so we know where we are, where we\nare going, and why we are going there. We must submit the strategies and\ntactics we formulate to the judgments of others, to ensure their efficiency\nand resilience. We need to listen to ourselves as we talk, as well, so that we\nmay organize our otherwise inchoate bodily reactions, motivations, and\nemotions into something articulate and organized, and dispense with those\nconcerns that are exaggerated and irrational. We need to talk\u2014both to\nremember and to forget.\nMy client desperately needed someone to listen to him. He also needed\nto be fully part of additional, larger, and more complex social groups\u2014\nsomething he planned in our sessions together, and then carried out on his\nown. Had he fallen prey to the temptation to denigrate the value of\ninterpersonal interactions and relationships because of his history of\nisolation and harsh treatment, he would have had very little chance of\nregaining his health and well-being. Instead, he learned the ropes and joined\nthe world.\n            ",

            "content": "\nFor Drs. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the great depth psychologists,\nsanity was a characteristic of the individual mind. People were welladjusted, in their views, when the subpersonalities existing within each of\nthem were properly integrated and balanced in expression. The id, the\ninstinctive part of the psyche (from the German \u201cit,\u201d representing nature, in\nall its power and foreignness, inside us); the superego (the sometimes\noppressive, internalized representative of social order); and the ego (the I,\nthe personality proper, crushed between those two necessary tyrants)\u2014all\nhad their specialized functions for Freud, who first conceptualized their\nexistence. Id, ego, and superego interacted with each other like the\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches of a modern government. Jung,\nalthough profoundly influenced by Freud, parsed the complexity of the\npsyche in a different manner. For him, the ego of the individual had to find\nits proper place in relationship to the shadow (the dark side of the\npersonality), the anima or animus (the contrasexual and thus often repressed\nside of the personality), and the self (the internal being of ideal possibility).\nBut all these different subentities, Jungian and Freudian alike, share one\nthing in common: they exist in the interior of the person, regardless of his or\nher surroundings. People are social beings, however\u2014par excellence\u2014and\nthere is no shortage of wisdom and guidance outside of us, embedded in the\nsocial world. Why rely on our own limited resources to remember the road,\nor to orient ourselves in new territory, when we can rely on signs and\nguideposts placed there so effortfully by others? Freud and Jung, with their\nintense focus on the autonomous individual psyche, placed too little focus\non the role of the community in the maintenance of personal mental health.\nIt is for such reasons that I assess the position of all my new clinical\nclients along a few dimensions largely dependent on the social world when\nI first start working with them: Have they been educated to the level of their\nintellectual ability or ambition? Is their use of free time engaging,\nmeaningful, and productive? Have they formulated solid and wellarticulated plans for the future? Are they (and those they are close to) free\nof any serious physical health or economic problems? Do they have friends\nand a social life? A stable and satisfying intimate partnership? Close and\nfunctional familial relationships? A career\u2014or, at least, a job\u2014that is\nfinancially sufficient, stable and, if possible, a source of satisfaction and\nopportunity? If the answer to any three or more of these questions is no, I\nconsider that my new client is insufficiently embedded in the interpersonal\nworld and is in danger of spiraling downward psychologically because of\nthat. People exist among other people and not as purely individual minds.\nAn individual does not have to be that well put together if he or she can\nremain at least minimally acceptable in behavior to others. Simply put: We\noutsource the problem of sanity. People remain mentally healthy not merely\nbecause of the integrity of their own minds, but because they are constantly\nbeing reminded how to think, act, and speak by those around them.\nIf you begin to deviate from the straight and narrow path\u2014if you begin\nto act improperly\u2014people will react to your errors before they become too\ngreat, and cajole, laugh, tap, and criticize you back into place. They will\nraise an eyebrow, or smile (or not), or pay attention (or not). If other people\ncan tolerate having you around, in other words, they will constantly remind\nyou not to misbehave, and just as constantly call on you to be at your best.\nAll that is left for you to do is watch, listen, and respond appropriately to\nthe cues. Then you might remain motivated, and able to stay together\nenough so that you will not begin the long journey downhill. This is reason\nenough to appreciate your immersion in the world of other people\u2014friends,\nfamily members, and foes alike\u2014despite the anxiety and frustration that\nsocial interactions so often produce.\nBut how did we develop the broad consensus regarding social behavior\nthat serves to buttress our psychological stability? It seems a daunting task\n\u2014if not impossible\u2014in the face of the complexity that constantly confronts\nus. \u201cDo we pursue this or that?\u201d \u201cHow does the worth of this piece of work\ncompare to the worth of that?\u201d \u201cWho is more competent, or more creative,\nor more assertive, and should therefore be ceded authority?\u201d Answers to\nsuch questions are largely formulated in consequence of intensive\nnegotiation\u2014verbal and nonverbal\u2014regulating individual action,\ncooperation, and competition. What we deem to be valuable and worthy of\nattention becomes part of the social contract; part of the rewards and\npunishments meted out respectively for compliance and noncompliance;\npart of what continually indicates and reminds: \u201cHere is what is valued.\nLook at that (perceive that) and not something else. Pursue that (act toward\nthat end) and not some other.\u201d Compliance with those indications and\nreminders is, in large measure, sanity itself\u2014and is something required\nfrom every one of us right from the early stages of our lives. Without the\nintermediation of the social world, it would be impossible for us to organize\nour minds, and we would simply be overwhelmed by the world.\n            ",

            "content": "\nI have the great good fortune of a granddaughter, Elizabeth Scarlett\nPeterson Korikova, born in August 2017. I have watched her carefully\nwhile she develops, trying to understand what she is up to and playing\nalong with it. When she was about a year and a half old, she engaged in all\nmanner of unbearably endearing behaviors\u2014giggling and laughing when\nshe was poked, high-fiving, bumping heads, and rubbing noses. However,\nin my opinion, the most noteworthy of all the actions she undertook at that\nage was her pointing.\nShe had discovered her index finger, using it to specify all the objects in\nthe world she found interesting. She delighted in doing so, particularly\nwhen her pointing called forth the attention of the adults surrounding her.\nThis indicated, in a manner not duplicable in any other way, that her action\nand intention had import\u2014definable at least in part as the tendency of a\nbehavior or attitude to compel the attention of others. She thrived on that,\nand no wonder. We compete for attention, personally, socially, and\neconomically. No currency has a value that exceeds it. Children, adults, and\nsocieties wither on the vine in its absence. To have others attend to what\nyou find important or interesting is to validate, first, the importance of what\nyou are attending to, but second, and more crucially, to validate you as a\nrespected center of conscious experience and contributor to the collective\nworld. Pointing is, as well, a crucial precursor to the development of\nlanguage. To name something\u2014to use the word for the thing\u2014is essentially\nto point to it, to specify it against everything else, to isolate it for use\nindividually and socially.\nWhen my granddaughter pointed, she did it publicly. When she pointed\nto something, she could immediately observe how the people close to her\nreacted. There is just not that much point, so to speak, in pointing to\nsomething that no one else cares about. So, she aimed her index finger at\nsomething she found interesting and then looked around to see if anyone\nelse cared. She was learning an important lesson at an early age: If you are\nnot communicating about anything that engages other people, then the value\nof your communication\u2014even the value of your very presence\u2014risks\nfalling to zero. It was in this manner that she began to more profoundly\nexplore the complex hierarchy of value that made up her family and the\nbroader society surrounding her.\nScarlett is now learning to talk\u2014a more sophisticated form of pointing\n(and of exploration). Every word is a pointer, as well as a simplification or\ngeneralization. To name something is not only to make it shine forth against\nthe infinite background of potentially nameable things, but to group or\ncategorize it, simultaneously, with many other phenomena of its broad\nutility or significance. We use the word \u201cfloor,\u201d for example, but do not\ngenerally employ a separate word for all the floors we might encounter\n(concrete, wood, earth, glass), much less all the endless variations of color\nand texture and shade that make up the details of the floors that bear our\nweight. We use a low-resolution representation: If it holds us up, we can\nwalk on it, and is situated inside a building, then it is a \u201cfloor,\u201d and that is\nprecise enough. The word distinguishes floors, say, from walls, but also\nrestricts the variability in all the floors that exist to a single concept\u2014flat,\nstable, walkable indoor surfaces.\nThe words we employ are tools that structure our experience,\nsubjectively and privately\u2014but are, equally, socially determined. We would\nnot all know and use the word \u201cfloor\u201d unless we had all agreed that there\nwas something sufficiently important about floors to justify a word for\nthem. So, the mere fact of naming something (and, of course, agreeing on\nthe name) is an important part of the process whereby the infinitely\ncomplex world of phenomena and fact is reduced to the functional world of\nvalue. And it is continual interaction with social institutions that makes this\nreduction\u2014this specification\u2014possible.\n            ",

            "content": "\nThe social world narrows and specifies the world for us, marking out what\nis important. But what does \u201cimportant\u201d mean? How is it determined? The\nindividual is molded by the social world. But social institutions are molded,\ntoo, by the requirements of the individuals who compose them.\nArrangements must be made for our provisioning with the basic\nrequirements of life. We cannot live without food, water, clean air, and\nshelter. Less self-evidently, we require companionship, play, touch, and\nintimacy. These are all biological as well as psychological necessities (and\nthis is by no means a comprehensive list). We must signify and then utilize\nthose elements of the world capable of providing us with these\nrequirements. And the fact that we are deeply social adds another set of\nconstraints to the situation: We must perceive and act in a manner that\nmeets our biological and psychological needs\u2014but, since none of us lives\nor can live in isolation, we must meet them in a manner approved of by\nothers. This means that the solutions we apply to our fundamental\nbiological problems must also be acceptable and implementable socially.\nIt is worth considering more deeply just how necessity limits the\nuniverse of viable solutions and implementable plans. First, as we alluded\nto, the plan must in principle solve some real problem. Second, it must\nappeal to others\u2014often in the face of competing plans\u2014or those others will\nnot cooperate and might well object. If I value something, therefore, I must\ndetermine how to value it so that others potentially benefit. It cannot just be\ngood for me: it must be good for me and for the people around me. And\neven that is not good enough\u2014which means there are even more constraints\non how the world must be perceived and acted upon. The manner in which I\nview and value the world, integrally associated with the plans I am making,\nhas to work for me, my family, and the broader community. Furthermore, it\nneeds to work today, in a manner that does not make a worse hash of\ntomorrow, next week, next month, and next year (even the next decade or\ncentury). A good solution to a problem involving suffering must be\nrepeatable, without deterioration across repetitions\u2014iterable, in a word\u2014\nacross people and across time.\nThese universal constraints, manifest biologically and imposed socially,\nreduce the complexity of the world to something approximating a\nuniversally understandable domain of value. That is exceptionally\nimportant, because there are unlimited problems and there are\nhypothetically unlimited potential solutions, but there are a comparatively\nlimited number of solutions that work practically, psychologically, and\nsocially simultaneously. The fact of limited solutions implies the existence\nof something like a natural ethic\u2014variable, perhaps, as human languages\nare variable, but still characterized by something solid and universally\nrecognizable at its base. It is the reality of this natural ethic that makes\nthoughtless denigration of social institutions both wrong and dangerous:\nwrong and dangerous because those institutions have evolved to solve\nproblems that must be solved for life to continue. They are by no means\nperfect\u2014but making them better, rather than worse, is a tricky problem\nindeed.\nSo, I must take the complexity of the world, reduce it to a single point so\nthat I can act, and take everyone else and their future selves into\nconsideration while I am doing so. How do I manage this? By\ncommunicating and negotiating. By outsourcing the terribly complex\ncognitive problem to the resources of the broader world. The individuals\nwho compose every society cooperate and compete linguistically (although\nlinguistic interaction by no means exhausts the means of cooperation and\ncompetition). Words are formulated collectively, and everyone must agree\non their use. The verbal framework that helps us delimit the world is a\nconsequence of the landscape of value that is constructed socially\u2014but also\nbounded by the brute necessity of reality itself. This helps give that\nlandscape shape, and not just any old shape. This is where hierarchies\u2014\nfunctional, productive hierarchies\u2014more clearly enter the picture.\nThings of import must be done, or people starve or die of thirst or\nexposure\u2014or of loneliness and absence of touch. What needs to be done\nmust be specified and planned. The requisite skills for doing so must be\ndeveloped. That specification, planning, and development of skills, as well\nas the implementation of the informed plan, must be conducted in social\nspace, with the cooperation of others (and in the face of their competition).\nIn consequence, some will be better at solving the problem at hand, and\nothers worse. This variance in ability (as well as the multiplicity of extant\nproblems and the impossibility of training everyone in all skilled domains)\nnecessarily engenders a hierarchical structure\u2014based ideally on genuine\ncompetence in relation to the goal. Such a hierarchy is in its essence a\nsocially structured tool that must be employed for the effective\naccomplishment of necessary and worthwhile tasks. It is also a social\ninstitution that makes progress and peace possible at the same time.\n            ",

            "content": "\nThe consensus making up the spoken and unspoken assumptions of worth\ncharacterizing our societies has an ancient origin, developing over the\ncourse of hundreds of millions of years. After all, \u201cHow should you act?\u201d is\njust the short-term, immediate version of the fundamental long-term\nquestion, \u201cHow should you survive?\u201d It is therefore instructive to look into\nthe distant past\u2014far down the evolutionary chain, right to the basics\u2014and\ncontemplate the establishment of what is important. The most\nphylogenetically ancient multicellular organisms (that is far enough for our\npurposes) tend to be composed of relatively undifferentiated sensorimotor\ncells.1\n These cells map certain facts or features of the environment directly\nonto the motor output of the same cells, in an essentially one-to-one\nrelationship. Stimulus A means response A, and nothing else, while\nstimulus B means response B. Among more differentiated and complex\ncreatures\u2014the larger and commonly recognizable denizens of the natural\nworld\u2014the sensory and motor functions separate and specialize, such that\ncells undertaking the former functions detect patterns in the world and cells\nin the latter produce patterns of motor output. This differentiation enables a\nbroader range of patterns to be recognized and mapped, as well as a broader\nrange of action and reaction to be undertaken. A third type of cell\u2014neural\n\u2014emerges sometimes, as well, serving as a computational intermediary\nbetween the first two. Among species that have established a neural level of\noperation, the \u201csame\u201d pattern of input can produce a different pattern of\noutput (depending, for example, on changes in the animal\u2019s environment or\ninternal psychophysical condition).\nAs nervous systems increase in sophistication, and more and more layers\nof neural intermediation emerge, the relationship between simple fact and\nmotor output becomes increasingly complex, unpredictable, and\nsophisticated. What is putatively the same thing or situation can be\nperceived in multiple ways, and two things perceived in the same manner\ncan still give rise to very different behaviors. It is very difficult to constrain\neven isolated laboratory animals, for example, so thoroughly that they will\nbehave predictably across trials that have been made as similar as possible.\nAs the layers of neural tissue mediating between sensation and action\nmultiply, they also differentiate. Basic motivational systems, often known\nas drives, appear (hunger, thirst, aggression, etc.), adding additional sensory\nand behavioral specificity and variability. Superseding motivations, in turn\n\u2014with no clear line of demarcation\u2014are systems of emotion. Cognitive\nsystems emerge much later, first taking form, arguably, as imagination, and\nlater\u2014and only among human beings\u2014as full-fledged language. Thus, in\nthe most complex of creatures, there is an internal hierarchy of structure,\nfrom reflex through drive to language-mediated action (in the particular\ncase of human beings), that must be organized before it can function as a\nunity and be aimed at a point.2\nHow is this hierarchy organized\u2014a structure that emerged in large part\nfrom the bottom up, over the vast spans of evolutionary time? We return to\nthe same answer alluded to earlier: through the constant cooperation and\ncompetition\u2014the constant jockeying for resources and position\u2014defining\nthe struggle for survival and reproduction. This happens over the\nunimaginably lengthy spans of time that characterize evolution, as well as\nthe much shorter course of each individual life. Negotiation for position\nsorts organisms into the omnipresent hierarchies that govern access to vital\nresources such as shelter, nourishment, and mates. All creatures of\nreasonable complexity and even a minimally social nature have their\nparticular place, and know it. All social creatures also learn what is deemed\nvaluable by other group members, and derive from that, as well as from the\nunderstanding of their own position, a sophisticated implicit and explicit\nunderstanding of value itself. In a phrase: The internal hierarchy that\ntranslates facts into actions mirrors the external hierarchy of social\norganization. It is clear, for example, that chimpanzees in a troop\nunderstand their social world and its hierarchical strata at a fine level of\ndetail. They know what is important, and who has privileged access to it.\nThey understand such things as if their survival and reproduction depend\nupon it, as it does.3\nA newborn infant is equipped with relatively deterministic reflexes:\nsucking, crying, startling. These nonetheless provide the starting point for\nthe immense range of skills in action that develop with human maturation.\nBy the age of two (and often much earlier than that, for many skills),\nchildren can orient with all their senses, walk upright, use their opposablethumb-equipped hands for all sorts of purposes, and communicate their\ndesires and needs both nonverbally and verbally\u2014and this is of course a\npartial list. This immense array of behavioral abilities is integrated into a\ncomplex assortment of emotions and motivational drives (anger, sadness,\nfear, joy, surprise, and more) and then organized to fulfill whatever specific,\nnarrow purpose inspires the child for the moment and, increasingly, over\nlonger spans of time.\nThe developing infant must also hone and perfect the operation of his or\nher currently dominant motivational state in harmony with all his or her\nother internal motivational states (as, for example, the separate desire to eat,\nsleep, and play must learn to coexist so each can manifest itself optimally),\nand in keeping with the demands, routines, and opportunities of the social\nenvironment. This honing and perfecting begin within the child\u2019s maternal\nrelationship and the spontaneous play behavior within that circumscribed\nbut still social context. Then, when the child has matured to the point where\nthe internal hierarchy of emotional and motivational functions can be\nsubsumed, even temporarily, within a framework provided by a conscious,\ncommunicable abstract goal (\u201clet us play house\u201d), the child is ready to play\nwith others\u2014and to do so, over time, in an increasingly complex and\nsophisticated manner.\nPlay with others depends (as the great developmental psychologist Jean\nPiaget observed) upon the collective establishment of a shared goal with\nthe child\u2019s play partners. The collective establishment of a shared goal\u2014the\npoint of the game\u2014conjoined with rules governing cooperation and\ncompetition in relationship to that goal or point, constitutes a true social\nmicrocosm. All societies might be regarded as variations upon this\nplay/game theme\u2014E pluribus unum*\u2014and in all functional and decent\nsocieties the basic rules of fair play, predicated upon reciprocity across\nsituation and time, come inevitably to apply. Games, like solutions to\nproblems, must be iterable to endure, and there are principles that apply to\nand undergird what constitutes that iterability. Piaget suspected, for\nexample, that games undertaken voluntarily will outcompete games\nimposed and played under threat of force, given that some of the energy that\ncould be expended on the game itself, whatever its nature, has to be wasted\non enforcement. There is evidence indicating the emergence of such\nvoluntary game-like arrangements even among our nonhuman kin.6\nThe universal rules of fair play include the ability to regulate emotion\nand motivation while cooperating and competing in pursuit of the goal\nduring the game (that is part and parcel of being able to play at all), as well\nas the ability and will to establish reciprocally beneficial interactions across\ntime and situation, as we already discussed. And life is not simply a game,\nbut a series of games, each of which has something in common (whatever\ndefines a game) and something unique (or there would be no reason for\nmultiple games). At minimum, there is a starting point (kindergarten, a 0\u20130\nscore, a first date, an entry-level job) that needs to be improved upon; a\nprocedure for enacting that improvement; and a desirable goal (graduation\nfrom high school, a winning score, a permanent romantic relationship, a\nprestigious career). Because of that commonality, there is an ethic\u2014or more\nproperly, a meta-ethic\u2014that emerges, from the bottom up, across the set of\nall games. The best player is therefore not the winner of any given game\nbut, among many other things, he or she who is invited by the largest\nnumber of others to play the most extensive series of games. It is for this\nreason, which you may not understand explicitly at the time, that you tell\nyour children: \u201cIt\u2019s not whether you win or lose. It\u2019s how you play the\ngame!\u201d* How should you play, to be that most desirable of players? What\nstructure must take form within you so that such play is possible? And those\ntwo questions are interrelated, because the structure that will enable you to\nplay properly (and with increasing and automated or habitual precision) will\nemerge only in the process of continually practicing the art of playing\nproperly. Where might you learn how to play? Everywhere . . . if you are\nfortunate and awake.\n            ",

            "content": "\nIt is useful to take your place at the bottom of a hierarchy. It can aid in the\ndevelopment of gratitude and humility. Gratitude: There are people whose\nexpertise exceeds your own, and you should be wisely pleased about that.\nThere are many valuable niches to fill, given the many complex and serious\nproblems we must solve. The fact that there are people who fill those niches\nwith trustworthy skill and experience is something for which to be truly\nthankful. Humility: It is better to presume ignorance and invite learning\nthan to assume sufficient knowledge and risk the consequent blindness. It is\nmuch better to make friends with what you do not know than with what you\ndo know, as there is an infinite supply of the former but a finite stock of the\nlatter. When you are tightly boxed in or cornered\u2014all too often by your\nown stubborn and fixed adherence to some unconsciously worshipped\nassumptions\u2014all there is to help you is what you have not yet learned.\nIt is necessary and helpful to be, and in some ways to remain, a beginner.\nFor this reason, the Tarot deck beloved by intuitives, romantics, fortunetellers, and scoundrels alike contains within it the Fool as a positive card, an\nillustrated variant of which opens this chapter. The Fool is a young,\nhandsome man, eyes lifted upward, journeying in the mountains, sun\nshining brightly upon him\u2014about to carelessly step over a cliff (or is he?).\nHis strength, however, is precisely his willingness to risk such a drop; to\nrisk being once again at the bottom. No one unwilling to be a foolish\nbeginner can learn. It was for this reason, among others, that Carl Jung\nregarded the Fool as the archetypal precursor to the figure of the equally\narchetypal Redeemer, the perfected individual.\nThe beginner, the fool, is continually required to be patient and tolerant\n\u2014with himself and, equally, with others. His displays of ignorance,\ninexperience, and lack of skill may still sometimes be rightly attributed to\nirresponsibility and condemned, justly, by others. But the insufficiency of\nthe fool is often better regarded as an inevitable consequence of each\nindividual\u2019s essential vulnerability, rather than as a true moral failing. Much\nthat is great starts small, ignorant, and useless. This lesson permeates\npopular as well as classical or traditional culture. Consider, for example, the\nDisney heroes Pinocchio and Simba, as well as J. K. Rowling\u2019s magical\nHarry Potter. Pinocchio begins as a wooden-headed marionette, the puppet\nof everyone\u2019s decisions but his own. The Lion King has his origin as a\nnaive cub, the unwitting pawn of a treacherous and malevolent uncle. The\nstudent of wizarding is an unloved orphan, with a dusty cupboard for a\nbedroom, and Voldemort\u2014who might as well be Satan himself\u2014for his\narchenemy. Great mythologized heroes often come into the world, likewise,\nin the most meager of circumstances (as the child of an Israelite slave, for\nexample, or newborn in a lowly manger) and in great danger (consider the\nPharaoh\u2019s decision to slay all the firstborn male babies of the Israelites, and\nHerod\u2019s comparable edict, much later). But today\u2019s beginner is tomorrow\u2019s\nmaster. Thus, it is necessary even for the most accomplished (but who\nwishes to accomplish still more) to retain identification with the as yet\nunsuccessful; to appreciate the striving toward competence; to carefully and\nwith true humility subordinate him or herself to the current game; and to\ndevelop the knowledge, self-control, and discipline necessary to make the\nnext move.\nI visited a restaurant in Toronto with my wife, son, and daughter while\nwriting this. As I made my way to my party\u2019s table, a young waiter asked if\nhe might say a few words to me. He told me that he had been watching my\nvideos, listening to my podcasts, and reading my book, and that he had, in\nconsequence, changed his attitude toward his comparatively lower-status\n(but still useful and necessary) job. He had ceased criticizing what he was\ndoing or himself for doing it, deciding instead to be grateful and seek out\nwhatever opportunities presented themselves right there before him. He\nmade up his mind to become more diligent and reliable and to see what\nwould happen if he worked as hard at it as he could. He told me, with an\nuncontrived smile, that he had been promoted three times in six months.\nThe young man had come to realize that every place he might find\nhimself in had more potential than he might first see (particularly when his\nvision was impaired by the resentment and cynicism he felt from being near\nthe bottom). After all, it is not as if a restaurant is a simple place\u2014and this\nwas part of an extensive national organization, a large, high-quality chain.\nTo do a good job in such a place, servers must get along with the cooks,\nwho are by universal recognition a formidably troublesome and tricky lot.\nThey must also be polite and engaging with customers. They have to pay\nattention constantly. They must adjust to highly varying workloads\u2014the\nrushes and dead times that inevitably accompany the life of a server. They\nhave to show up on time, sober and awake. They must treat their superiors\nwith the proper respect and do the same for those\u2014such as the dishwashers\n\u2014below them in the structure of authority. And if they do all these things,\nand happen to be working in a functional institution, they will soon render\nthemselves difficult to replace. Customers, colleagues, and superiors alike\nwill begin to react to them in an increasingly positive manner. Doors that\nwould otherwise remain closed to them\u2014even invisible\u2014will be opened.\nFurthermore, the skills they acquire will prove eminently portable, whether\nthey continue to rise in the hierarchy of restaurateurs, decide instead to\nfurther their education, or change their career trajectory completely (in\nwhich case they will leave with laudatory praise from their previous\nemployers and vastly increased chances of discovering the next\nopportunity).\nAs might be expected, the young man who had something to say to me\nwas thrilled with what had happened to him. His status concerns had been\nsolidly and realistically addressed by his rapid career advance, and the\nadditional money he was making did not hurt, either. He had accepted, and\ntherefore transcended, his role as a beginner. He had ceased being casually\ncynical about the place he occupied in the world and the people who\nsurrounded him, and accepted the structure and the position he was offered.\nHe started to see possibility and opportunity, where before he was blinded,\nessentially, by his pride. He stopped denigrating the social institution he\nfound himself part of and began to play his part properly. And that\nincrement in humility paid off in spades.\n            ",

            "content": "\nIt is good to be a beginner, but it is a good of a different sort to be an equal\namong equals. It is said, with much truth, that genuine communication can\ntake place only between peers. This is because it is very difficult to move\ninformation up a hierarchy. Those well positioned (and this is a great danger\nof moving up) have used their current competence\u2014their cherished\nopinions, their present knowledge, their current skills\u2014to stake a moral\nclaim to their status. In consequence, they have little motivation to admit to\nerror, to learn or change\u2014and plenty of reason not to. If a subordinate\nexposes the ignorance of someone with greater status, he risks humiliating\nthat person, questioning the validity of the latter\u2019s claim to influence and\nstatus, and revealing him as incompetent, outdated, or false. For this reason,\nit is very wise to approach your boss, for example, carefully and privately\nwith a problem (and perhaps best to have a solution at hand\u2014and not one\nproffered too incautiously).\nBarriers exist to the flow of genuine information down a hierarchy, as\nwell. For example, the resentment people lower in the chain of command\nmight feel about their hypothetically lesser position can make them loath to\nact productively on information from above\u2014or, in the worst case, can\nmotivate them to work at counterpurposes to what they have learned, out of\nsheer spite. In addition, those who are inexperienced or less educated, or\nwho newly occupy a subordinate position and therefore lack knowledge of\ntheir surroundings, can be more easily influenced by relative position and\nthe exercise of power, instead of quality of argumentation and observation\nof competence. Peers, by contrast, must in the main be convinced. Their\nattention must be carefully reciprocated. To be surrounded by peers is to\nexist in a state of equality, and to manifest the give-and-take necessary to\nmaintain that equality. It is therefore good to be in the middle of a hierarchy.\nThis is partly why friendships are so important, and why they form so\nearly in life. A two-year-old, typically, is self-concerned, although also\ncapable of simple reciprocal actions. The same Scarlett whom I talked\nabout earlier\u2014my granddaughter\u2014would happily hand me one of her\nfavorite stuffed toys, attached to a pacifier, when I asked her to. Then I\nwould hand it, or toss it, back (sometimes she would toss it to me, too\u2014or\nat least relatively near me). She loved this game. We played it with a spoon,\nas well\u2014an implement she was just beginning to master. She played the\nsame way with her mother and her grandmother\u2014with anyone who\nhappened to be within playing distance, if she was familiar enough with\nthem not to be shy. This was the beginning of the behaviors that transform\nthemselves into full-fledged sharing among older children.\nMy daughter, Mikhaila, Scarlett\u2019s mother, took her child to the outdoor\nrecreational space on top of their downtown condo a few days before I\nwrote this. A number of other children were playing there, most of them\nolder, and there were plenty of toys. Scarlett spent her time hoarding as\nmany of the playthings as possible near her mother\u2019s chair, and was\ndistinctly unimpressed if other children came along to purloin one for\nthemselves. She even took a ball directly from another child to add to her\ncollection. This is typical behavior for children two and younger. Their\nability to reciprocate, while hardly absent (and able to manifest itself in\ntruly endearing ways), is developmentally limited.\nBy three years of age, however, most children are capable of truly\nsharing. They can delay gratification long enough to take their turn while\nplaying a game that everyone cannot play simultaneously. They can begin\nto understand the point of a game played by several people and follow the\nrules, although they may not be able to give a coherent verbal account of\nwhat those rules are. They start to form friendships upon repeated exposure\nto children with whom they have successfully negotiated reciprocal play\nrelationships. Some of these friendships turn into the first intense\nrelationships that children have outside their family. It is in the context of\nsuch relationships, which tend strongly to form between equals in age (or at\nleast equals in developmental stage), that a child learns to bond tightly to a\npeer and starts to learn how to treat another person properly while requiring\nthe same in return.\nThis mutual bonding is vitally important. A child without at least one\nspecial, close friend is much more likely to suffer later psychological\nproblems, whether of the depressive/anxious or antisocial sort, while\nchildren with fewer friends are also more likely to be unemployed and\nunmarried as adults.\n There is no evidence that the importance of friendship\ndeclines in any manner with age.* All causes of mortality appear to be\nreduced among adults with high-quality social networks, even when general\nhealth status is taken into consideration. This remains true among the\nelderly in the case of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, emphysema,\nand arthritis, and for younger and older adults alike in the case of heart\nattacks. Interestingly enough, there is some evidence that it is the provision\nof social support, as much or more than its receipt, that provides these\nprotective benefits (and, somewhat unsurprisingly, that those who give\nmore tend to receive more). Thus, it truly seems that it is better to give than to receive.\nPeers distribute both the burdens and joys of life. Recently, when my\nwife, Tammy, and I suffered serious health problems, we were fortunate\nenough to have family members (my in-laws, sister and brother; my own\nmother and sister; our children) and close friends stay with us and help for\nsubstantial periods of time. They were willing to put their own lives on hold\nto aid us while we were in crisis. Before that, when my book 12 Rules for\nLife became a success, and during the extensive speaking tour that\nfollowed, Tammy and I were close to people with whom we could share our\ngood fortune. These were friends and family members genuinely pleased\nwith what was happening and following the events of our lives avidly, and\nwho were willing to discuss what could have been the overwhelming public\nresponse. This greatly heightened the significance and meaning of\neverything we were doing and reduced the isolation that such a dramatic\nshift in life circumstances, for better or worse, is likely to produce.\nThe relationships established with colleagues of similar status at work\nconstitute another important source of peer regulation, in addition to\nfriendship. To maintain good relationships with your colleagues means,\namong other things, to give credit where credit is due; to take your fair\nshare of the jobs no one wants but still must be done; to deliver on time and\nin a high-quality manner when teamed with other people; to show up when\nexpected; and, in general, to be trusted to do somewhat more than your job\nformally requires. The approval or disapproval of your colleagues rewards\nand enforces this continual reciprocity, and that\u2014like the reciprocity that is\nnecessarily part of friendship\u2014helps maintain stable psychological\nfunction. It is much better to be someone who can be relied upon, not least\nso that during times of personal trouble the people you have worked beside\nare willing and able to step in and help.\n            ",

            "content": "\nHow, then, is the personality that balances respect for social institutions\nand, equally, creative transformation to be understood? It is not so easy to\ndetermine, given the complexity of the problem. For that reason, we turn to\nstories. Stories provide us with a broad template. They outline a pattern\nspecific enough to be of tremendous value, if we can imitate it, but general\nenough (unlike a particular rule or set of rules) to apply even to new\nsituations. In stories, we capture observations of the ideal personality. We\ntell tales about success and failure in adventure and romance. Across our\nnarrative universes, success moves us forward to what is better, to the\npromised land; failure dooms us, and those who become entangled with us,\nto the abyss. The good moves us upward and ahead, and evil drags us\nbackward and down. Great stories are about characters in action, and so\nthey mirror the unconscious structures and processes that help us translate\nthe intransigent world of facts into the sustainable, functional, reciprocal\nsocial world of values.*\nThe properly embodied hierarchy of values\u2014including the value of\nconservatism and its twin, creative transformation\u2014finds its expression as a\npersonality, in narrative\u2014an ideal personality. Every hierarchy has\nsomething at its pinnacle. It is for this reason that a story, which is a\ndescription of the action of a personality, has a hero (and even if that\nsomeone is the antihero, it does not matter: the antihero serves the function\nof identifying the hero through contrast, as the hero is what the antihero is\nmost decidedly not). The hero is the individual at the peak, the victor, the\nchampion, the wit, the eventually successful and deserving underdog, the\nspeaker of truth under perilous circumstances, and more. The stories we\ncreate, watch, listen to, and remember center themselves on actions and\nattitudes we find interesting, compelling, and worthy of communication as a\nconsequence of our personal experience with both admirable and detestable\npeople (or fragments of their specific attitudes and actions), or because of\nour proclivity to share what has gripped our attention with those who\nsurround us. Sometimes we can draw compelling narratives directly from\nour personal experience with individual people; sometimes we create\namalgams of multiple personalities, often in concert with those who\ncompose our social groups.\nThe client whose story was told in part earlier had a life usefully\nemployed as an example of the necessity of social engagement. That tale\ndid not, however, exhaust the significance of his transformed attitudes and\nactions. While he was reconstructing his social life, becoming an active\nparticipant in a range of collective activities, he simultaneously developed a\ncertain creative expertise that was equally unexpected. He had not benefited\nfrom formal education beyond the high school level, and did not have a\npersonality that immediately struck the external observer as markedly\ncreative. However, the personally novel social pursuits that attracted him\nwere in the main oriented toward aesthetic endeavor.\nHe first developed his eye for form, symmetry, novelty, and beauty as a\nphotographer. The social advantages of this pursuit were manifold: he\njoined a club that had its members attend biweekly photography walks,\nwhere they would sojourn as a group of twenty or so to parts of the city that\nwere visually interesting, either for their natural beauty or uniqueness or for\nthe attraction they held as industrial landscapes. He learned a fair bit about\nphotographic equipment, technically, because of doing so. The group\nmembers also critiqued one another\u2019s work\u2014and they did this\nconstructively, which meant that all of them appeared to indicate what\nerrors had been made but also what of value had been managed.\nThis all helped my client learn to communicate in a productive manner\nabout topics that might otherwise have been psychologically difficult\n(touching as they did on criticisms that, because of their association with\ncreative vision, could easily have generated counterproductively sensitive\noverreactions) and, as well, to increasingly distinguish between visual\nimages that were trite or dull or conformist and those of genuine quality.\nAfter a few months, his perception had developed sufficiently so that he\nbegan to win local contests and generate small professional commissions. I\nhad believed from the beginning that his participation in the photography\nclub was well advised from the perspective of personality development, but\nI was genuinely struck by the rapid development of his visual and technical\nability and very much enjoyed the times we spent in our sessions reviewing\nhis work.\nAfter a few months of work on the photography front, my client began to\nproduce and to show me other images he had created, as well\u2014which were\nin their first incarnation decidedly amateurish abstract line drawings done in\npen. These essentially consisted of loops of various sizes, joined\ncontinuously, on a single page: scribbles, really, although more controlled\nand evidently purposeful than mere scribbles. As I had with the\nphotographs (and the photography club), I regarded these as\npsychologically useful\u2014as an extension of creative ability\u2014but not as\nworthwhile artistic endeavors in their own right. He kept at it, however,\ngenerating several drawings a week, all the while bringing what he had\ncreated to our sessions. What he produced increased in sophistication and\nbeauty with dramatic rapidity. Soon, he was drawing complex, symmetrical,\nand rather dramatic black-and-white pen-and-ink drawings of sufficient\nintrinsic beauty to serve as commercially viable T-shirt designs.\nI had seen this sort of development clearly in the case of two other\nclients, both characterized by intrinsically creative temperaments (very well\nhidden in one of the cases; more developed, nurtured, and obvious in the\nother). In addition, I had read accounts of clinical cases and personal\ndevelopment by Carl Jung, who noted that the production of increasingly\nordered and complex geometrical figures\u2014often circles within squares, or\nthe reverse\u2014regularly accompanied an increase in organization of the\npersonality. This certainly seemed true not only of my client, as evidenced\nby his burgeoning expertise at photography and the development of his skill\nas a graphic artist, but also of the two others I had the pleasure of serving as\na clinical therapist. What I observed repeatedly was, therefore, not only the\nreconstruction of the psyche as a consequence of further socialization (and\nthe valuation of social institutions) but the parallel transformation of\nprimarily interior processes, indicated by a marked increase in the capacity\nto perceive and to create what was elegant, beautiful, and socially valued.\nMy clients had learned not only to submit properly to the sometimes\narbitrary but still necessary demands of the social world, but to offer to that\nworld something it would not have had access to had it not been for their\nprivate creative work.\nMy granddaughter, Scarlett, also came to exhibit behaviors that were\nindicative of, if not her creative ability, then at least her appreciation for\ncreative ability, in addition to her socialization as an agent of socially\nvalued pointing. When people discuss a story\u2014presented as a movie, or a\nplay, or a book\u2014they commonly attempt to come to a sophisticated\nconsensus about its point (sophisticated because a group of people can\ngenerally offer more viewpoints than a single individual; consensus because\nthe discussion usually continues until some broad agreement is reached as\nto the topic at hand). Now, the idea that a story is a form of communication\n\u2014and entertainment\u2014is one of those facts that appears self-evident upon\nfirst consideration, but that becomes more mysterious the longer it is\npondered. If it is true that a story has a point, then it is clear that it is\npointing to something. But what, and how? What constitutes pointing is\nobvious when it is an action specifying a particular thing, or a person by a\nparticular person, but much less obvious when it is something typifying the\ncumulative behavior, shall we say, of a character in a story.\nThe actions and attitudes of J. K. Rowling\u2019s heroes and heroines once\nagain provide popular examples of precisely this process. Harry Potter, Ron\nWeasley, and Hermione Granger are typified in large part by the willingness\nand ability to follow rules (indicating their expertise as apprentices) and,\nsimultaneously, to break them. While those who supervise them are\ninclined, equally, to reward both apparently paradoxical forms of behavior.\nEven the technologies used by the young wizards during their\napprenticeship are characterized by this duality. The Marauder\u2019s Map, for\nexample (which provides its bearer with an accurate representation of\nexplored territory in the form of the physical layout or geography of\nHogwarts, the wizarding school, as well as the locale of all its living\ndenizens), can be activated as a functional tool only by uttering a set of\nwords that seem to indicate the very opposite of moral behavior: \u201cI\nsolemnly swear that I am up to no good,\u201d and deactivated, so that its\nfunction remains secret, with the phrase \u201cMischief managed.\u201d\nIt is no easy matter to understand how an artifact that requires such\nstatements to make it usable could possibly be anything but \u201cno good\u201d\u2014a\ntool of evil purpose, apparently. But, like the fact that Harry and his friends\nregularly but carefully break rules, and are equally regularly and carefully\nrewarded for doing so, the Marauder\u2019s Map varies in its ethical desirability\nwith the intent of its users. There is a strong implication throughout the\nseries that what is good cannot be simply encapsulated by mindless or rigid\nrule following, no matter how disciplined that following, or how vital the\nrules so followed. What this all means is that the Harry Potter series does\nnot point to drone-like subservience to social order as the highest of moral\nvirtues. What supersedes that obedience is not so obvious that it can be\neasily articulated, but it is something like \u201cFollow rules except when doing\nso undermines the purpose of those selfsame rules\u2014in which case take the\nrisk of acting in a manner contrary to what has been agreed upon as moral.\u201d\nThis is a lesson that seems more easily taught by representations of the\nbehaviors that embody it than transmitted by, say, rote learning or a variant\nrule. Meta-rules (which might be regarded as rules about rules, rather than\nrules themselves) are not necessarily communicated in the same manner as\nsimple rules themselves.\nScarlett, with her emphasis on pointing, learned soon after mastering the\ncomparatively straightforward physical act, to grasp the more complex\npoint of narratives. She could signify something with her index finger at the\nage of a year and a half. By two and a half years, however, she could\nunderstand and imitate the far more intricate point of a story. For a period of\napproximately six months, at the latter age, she would insist, when asked,\nthat she was Pocahontas, rather than Ellie (the name preferred by her father)\nor Scarlett (preferred by her mother). This was a staggering act of\nsophisticated thought, as far as I was concerned. She had been given a\nPocahontas doll, which became one of her favorite toys, along with a baby\ndoll (also very well loved), who she named after her grandmother, my wife,\nTammy. When she played with the infant doll, Ellie was the mother. With\nPocahontas, however, the situation differed. That doll was not a baby, and\nEllie was not its mother. My granddaughter regarded herself, instead, as the\ngrown Pocahontas\u2014mimicking the doll, which was fashioned like a young\nwoman, as well as the character who served as the lead in the Disney movie\nof the same name, which she had raptly observed on two separate\noccasions.\nThe Disney Pocahontas bore marked similarities to the main protagonists\nof the Harry Potter series. She finds herself promised by her father to\nKocoum, a brave warrior who embodies, in all seriousness, the virtues of\nhis tribe, but whose behavior and attitudes are too rule bound for the more\nexpansive personality of his bride-to-be. Pocahontas falls in love, instead,\nwith John Smith, captain of a ship from Europe and representative of that\nwhich falls outside of known territory but is (potentially) of great value.\nParadoxically, Pocahontas is pursuing a higher moral order in rejecting\nKocoum for Smith\u2014breaking a profoundly important rule (value what is\nmost valued in the current culture\u2019s hierarchy of rules)\u2014very much in the\nsame manner as the primary Potter characters. That is the moral of both\nnarratives: follow the rules until you are capable of being a shining\nexemplar of what they represent, but break them when those very rules now\nconstitute the most dire impediment to the embodiment of their central\nvirtues. And Elizabeth Scarlett, not yet three years of age, had the intrinsic\nwisdom to see this as the point of what she was watching (the Disney\nmovie) and using as a role-playing aid (the doll Pocahontas). Her\nperspicacity in this regard bordered on the unfathomable.\nThe same set of ideas\u2014respect for the rules, except when following\nthose rules means disregarding or ignoring or remaining blind to an even\nhigher moral principle\u2014is represented with stunning power in two different\nGospel narratives (which serve, regardless of your opinion about them, as\ncentral traditional or classical stories portraying a personality for the\npurposes of evoking imitation). In the first, Christ is presented, even as a\nchild, as a master of the Jewish tradition. This makes him fully informed as\nto the value of the past, and portrays him as characterized by the respect\ntypical, say, of the genuine conservative.\nA paradox emerges, however, as the entirety of the Gospel accounts are\nconsidered\u2014one closely associated with the tension between respect for\ntradition and the necessity for creative transformation. Despite the evidence\nof His thorough and even precocious understanding and appreciation of the\nrules, the adult Christ repeatedly and scandalously violates the Sabbath\ntraditions\u2014at least from the standpoint of the traditionalists in His\ncommunity, and much to His own peril. He leads His disciples through a\ncornfield, for example, plucking and eating the grains (Luke 6:1). He\njustifies this to the Pharisees who object by referring to an account of King\nDavid acting in a similar manner, feeding his people when necessity\ndemanded it on bread that was reserved for the priests (Luke 6:4). Christ\ntells his interlocutors quite remarkably \u201cthat the Son of man is Lord also of\nthe sabbath\u201d (Luke 6:5).\nAn ancient document known as the Codex Bezae,* a noncanonical\nvariant of part of the New Testament, offers an interpolation just after the\nsection of the Gospel of Luke presented above, shedding profound light on\nthe same issue. It offers deeper insight into the complex and paradoxical\nrelationship between respect for the rules and creative moral action that is\nnecessary and desirable, despite manifesting itself in apparent opposition to\nthose rules. It contains an account of Christ addressing someone who, like\nHim, has broken a sacred rule: \u201cOn that same day, observing one working\non the Sabbath, [Jesus] said to him O Man, if indeed thou knowest what\nthou doest, thou art blest; but if thou knowest not, thou art accursed, and a\ntransgressor of the Law.\u201d12\nWhat does this statement mean? It sums up the meaning of Rule I\nperfectly. If you understand the rules\u2014their necessity, their sacredness, the\nchaos they keep at bay, how they unite the communities that follow them,\nthe price paid for their establishment, and the danger of breaking them\u2014but\nyou are willing to fully shoulder the responsibility of making an exception,\nbecause you see that as serving a higher good (and if you are a person with\nsufficient character to manage that distinction), then you have served the\nspirit, rather than the mere law, and that is an elevated moral act. But if you\nrefuse to realize the importance of the rules you are violating and act out of\nself-centered convenience, then you are appropriately and inevitably\ndamned. The carelessness you exhibit with regard to your own tradition will\nundo you and perhaps those around you fully and painfully across time.\nThis is in keeping with other sentiments and acts of Christ described in\nthe Gospels. Matthew 12:11 states: \u201cAnd he said unto them, What man\nshall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit\non the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?\u201d Luke chapter\n6 describes Him healing a man with a withered hand on another Sabbath,\nstating \u201cIt is lawful on the Sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save\nlife, or destroy it?\u201d (Luke 6:9). This psychologically and conceptually\npainful juxtaposition of two moral stances (the keeping of the Sabbath\nversus the injunction to do good) is something else that constantly enrages\nthe Pharisees, and is part of the series of events that eventually leads to\nChrist\u2019s arrest and Crucifixion. These stories portray the existential\ndilemma that eternally characterizes human life: it is necessary to conform,\nto be disciplined, and to follow the rules\u2014to do humbly what others do; but\nit is also necessary to use judgment, vision, and the truth that guides\nconscience to tell what is right, when the rules suggest otherwise. It is the\nability to manage this combination that truly characterizes the fully\ndeveloped personality: the true hero.\nA certain amount of arbitrary rule-ness must be tolerated\u2014or welcomed,\ndepending on your point of view\u2014to keep the world and its inhabitants\ntogether. A certain amount of creativity and rebellion must be tolerated\u2014or\nwelcomed, depending on your point of view\u2014to maintain the process of\nregeneration. Every rule was once a creative act, breaking other rules.\nEvery creative act, genuine in its creativity, is likely to transform itself, with\ntime, into a useful rule. It is the living interaction between social institutions\nand creative achievement that keeps the world balanced on the narrow line\nbetween too much order and too much chaos. This is a terrible conundrum,\na true existential burden. We must support and value the past, and we need\nto do that with an attitude of gratitude and respect. At the same time,\nhowever, we must keep our eyes open\u2014we, the visionary living\u2014and\nrepair the ancient mechanisms that stabilize and support us when they falter.\nThus, we need to bear the paradox that is involved in simultaneously\nrespecting the walls that keep us safe and allowing in enough of what is\nnew and changing so that our institutions remain alive and healthy. The\nvery world depends for its stability and its dynamism on the subsuming of\nall our endeavors under the perfection\u2014the sacredness\u2014of that dual ability.\nDo not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement\n            ",

            "content": "\nHow do you know who you are? After all, you are complex beyond your\nown understanding; more complex than anything else that exists, excepting\nother people; complex beyond belief. And your ignorance is further\ncomplicated by the intermingling of who you are with who you could be.\nYou are not only something that is. You are something that is becoming\u2014\nand the potential extent of that becoming also transcends your\nunderstanding. Everyone has the sense, I believe, that there is more to them\nthan they have yet allowed to be realized. That potential is often obscured\nby poor health, misfortune, and the general tragedies and mishaps of life.\nBut it can also be hidden by an unwillingness to take full advantage of the\nopportunities that life offers\u2014abetted by regrettable errors of all sorts,\nincluding failures of discipline, faith, imagination, and commitment. Who\nare you? And, more importantly, who could you be, if you were everything\nyou could conceivably be?\nAre such questions impossible to answer, or are there sources available\nto us from which guidance might be derived? After all, we have been\nobserving ourselves behave\u2014in our successes and failures\u2014for tens\n(perhaps hundreds) of thousands of years. During that time, our shamans,\nprophets, mystics, artists, poets, and bards have distilled something vital\nfrom such observations\u2014some concentrated essence of what makes us\nhuman in actuality and possibility. In doing so, they have provided us with\nrepresentations of that vital essence, presenting itself to us as that which can\nbe neither ignored nor forgotten. Those creative people write and act out the\ndramas and tell us the stories that capture our imagination, and they fill our\ndreams with visions of what might be. The deepest and most profound of\nthese are remembered, discussed, and otherwise honed collectively, and\nmade the focus of rituals that unite us across the centuries, forming the very\nbasis of our cultures. These are the stories upon which the ritual, religious,\nand philosophical edifices characterizing sophisticated, populous,\nsuccessful societies are built.\nThe stories we can neither ignore nor forget are unforgettable for this\nreason (among others): They speak to something we know, but do not know\nthat we know. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates believed that all\nlearning was a form of remembering. Socrates posited that the soul,\nimmortal in its essence, knew everything before it was born anew as an\ninfant. However, at the point of birth all previous knowledge was forgotten\nand had to be recalled through the experiences of life. There is much to be\nsaid for this hypothesis, strange as it might now appear. There is much that\nwe could do\u2014much that our bodies and minds are capable of doing\u2014that\nremains dormant, right down to the genetic level. Exposure to new\nexperience activates this dormant potential, releasing abilities built into us\nover the vast span of our evolutionary history. This is perhaps the most\nbasic manner in which our bodies retain past wisdom and draw upon it\nwhen necessary. It is in this way, although not only in this way, that human\npossibility exists. Thus, there is something profound to be said for the\nconcept of learning as remembering.\nObviously, as well as \u201cremembering\u201d (as in the turning on of innate but\nhidden possibilities), we can learn much that is new. This is one of the\nprimary factors differentiating us from animals. Even complex and\nintelligent mammals such as chimpanzees and dolphins tend to repeat their\nspecies-typical behaviors generation after generation, with very little\nchange. Humans, by contrast, can and continually do seek out and\nencounter what is new, investigate and adapt to it, and make it part of\nthemselves. We can, as well, translate something we already know at one\nlevel of representation into knowledge at another. We can watch the actions\nof a living creature, animal or human, and then imitate them, translating our\nperceptions of their movement into new movements of our own. We can\neven generalize such imitative acts, catching the \u201cspirit\u201d of what or whom\nwe are observing, and producing new ways of seeing and acting that are in\nsome manner similar to that spirit.* This is part of what makes up the basis\nof the deeply embodied implicit knowledge that forms so much of the basis\nof our true understanding. We can also observe someone act or something\noccur and write down what we see, translating action into language that\noutlasts its utterance\u2014and then communicate it later in the absence of what\nor whom is being described. Finally, and most mysteriously, we can\nimagine and then act out something that has simply not been seen before,\nsomething that is truly original. And we can code and represent all that\nability\u2014adaptive action and its transformation\u2014in the stories we tell about\nthose we admire, as well as those we hate. And that is how we determine\nwho we are, and who we could perhaps become.\nStories become unforgettable when they communicate sophisticated\nmodes of being\u2014complex problems and equally complex solutions\u2014that\nwe perceive, consciously, in pieces, but cannot fully articulate. It was for\nthis reason, for example, that the biblical story of Moses and the Israelites\u2019\nexodus from Egypt became such a powerful touchstone for black slaves\nseeking emancipation in the United States:\nGo down, Moses, way down in Egypt land\nTell old Pharaoh\nTo let my people go.2\nThe biblical story of Exodus is properly regarded as archetypal (or\nparadigmatic or foundational) by psychoanalytic and religious thinkers\nalike, because it presents an example of psychological and social\ntransformation that cannot be improved upon. It emerged as a product of\nimagination and has been transformed by constant collective retelling and\nreworking into an ultimately meaningful form that applies politically,\neconomically, historically, personally, and spiritually, all at the same time.\nThis is the very definition of literary depth\u2014something that reaches its\napogee in certain forms of ancient, traditional stories. The fact of that depth\nmeans that such accounts can be used diversely as a meaningful frame for\nany process of profound change experienced by any individual or society\n(stable state, descent into chaos, reestablishment of stability), and can lend\nthat process multidimensional reality, context, powerful meaning, and\nmotivation.\n            ",

            "content": "\nHow might an unforgettable story come to be? What might precede its\nrevelation? It is at the very least the consequence of a long period of\nobservation. Imagine a scientist monitoring the behavior of a wolf pack, or\na troop of chimps\u2014indeed, any group of complex social animals. He or she\nattempts to identify regularities in the behavior of the individuals and the\ngroup (patterns, in a word) and to articulate those regularities\u2014to\nencapsulate them in language. The scientist might first relate a series of\nanecdotes about animal actions emblematic of the general behavior of the\nspecies. He or she might then abstract even further, attempting to generalize\nacross anecdotes with rule-like descriptions. I say \u201crule-like\u201d because the\nanimals are not following rules. Rules require language. Animals are\nmerely acting out regularities. They cannot formulate, understand, or follow\nrules.\nBut human beings? We can observe ourselves acting, as a scientist might\n\u2014more accurately, as a storyteller might. Then we can tell the stories to\neach other. The stories are already distillations of observed behavior (if they\nare not distillations, they will not be interesting; relating a sequence of\neveryday actions does not make for a good story). Once the story is\nestablished, we can analyze it, looking for deeper patterns and regularities.\nIf that analysis is successful, we can generalize across anecdotes with the\nformulation of rules, and then we can learn, consciously, to follow those\nrules. Here is how this might happen. We all react judgmentally when a\nchild or adult\u2014or, indeed, a society\u2014is acting improperly, unfairly, or\nbadly. The error strikes us emotionally. We intuit that a pattern upon which\nindividual and social adaptation depends has been disrupted and violated.\nWe are annoyed, frustrated, hurt, or grief-stricken at the betrayal. This does\nnot mean that each of us, reacting emotionally, has been successful at\narticulating a comprehensive philosophy of good and evil. We may never\nput our finger on what has gone wrong. However, like children unfamiliar\nwith a new game but still able to play it, we know that the rules are being\nbroken.\nSomething precisely like this is portrayed in the biblical story of Exodus,\nthe ancient account of the flight of the Hebrew slaves from their Egyptian\nmasters. Moses, who leads the escaping people, is continually called upon\nby his followers to draw very fine moral distinctions when they struggle\nwith one another and seek his advice. In consequence, he spends a very\nlong time observing and contemplating their behavior. It is as if the desert\nprophet had to discover what rules he and his Israelite followers were\nalready struggling to act out, prior to his receipt of the explicit\ncommandments from God. Remember: Every society is already\ncharacterized by patterned behavior; otherwise it would be pure conflict and\nno \u201csociety\u201d at all. But the mere fact that social order reigns to some degree\ndoes not mean that a given society has come to explicitly understand its\nown behavior, its own moral code. It is therefore no accident that in this\nstory Moses serves as a judge for his followers\u2014and does so with sufficient\nduration and intensity to exhaust himself\u2014before he receives the Ten\nCommandments:\nAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the\npeople: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto\nthe evening.\nAnd when Moses\u2019 father in law saw all that he did to the\npeople, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people?\nwhy sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee\nfrom morning unto even?\nAnd Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people\ncome unto me to inquire of God:\nWhen they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge\nbetween one and another, and I do make them know the statutes\nof God, and his laws.\nAnd Moses\u2019 father in law said unto him, The thing that thou\ndoest is not good.\nThou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is\nwith thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to\nperform it thyself alone. (Exodus 18: 13\u201318)\nThis difficult exercise in discrimination and judgment, observing and\nweighing, is an integral part of what prepared the biblical patriarch for the\nreceipt of divine revelation. If there had been no behavioral base for those\nrules\u2014no historical precedent codified in traditional ethics, no conventions,\nand no endless hours of observation of the moral patterns\u2014the\ncommandments simply could not have been understood and communicated,\nmuch less obeyed. An unforgettable story captures the essence of humanity and distills,\ncommunicates, and clarifies it, bringing what we are and what we should be\ninto focus. It speaks to us, motivating the attention that inspires us to\nimitate. We learn to see and act in the manner of the heroes of the stories\nthat captivate us. These stories call to capacities that lie deep within our\nnature but might still never develop without that call. We are dormant\nadventurers, lovers, leaders, artists, and rebels, but need to discover that we\nare all those things by seeing the reflection of such patterns in dramatic and\nliterary form. That is part of being a creature that is part nature and part\nculture. An unforgettable story advances our capacity to understand our\nbehavior, beyond habit and expectation, toward an imaginative and then\nverbalized understanding. Such a story presents us in the most compelling\nmanner with the ultimate adventure, the divine romance, and the eternal\nbattle between good and evil. All this helps us clarify our understanding of\nmoral and immoral attitude and action, personal and social. This can be\nseen everywhere, and always.\nQuestion: Who are you\u2014or, at least, who could you be? Answer: Part of\nthe eternal force that constantly confronts the terrible unknown, voluntarily;\npart of the eternal force that transcends naivete and becomes dangerous\nenough, in a controlled manner, to understand evil and beard it in its lair;\nand part of the eternal force that faces chaos and turns it into productive\norder, or that takes order that has become too restrictive, reduces it to chaos,\nand renders it productive once again.\nAnd all of this, being very difficult to understand consciously but vital to\nour survival, is transmitted in the form of the stories that we cannot help but\nattend to. And it is in this manner that we come to apprehend what is of\nvalue, what we should aim at, and what we could be. I would like to try my hand at explaining the meaning of the illustration,\nbased on an ancient alchemical woodcut, that opens this chapter. Describing\nwhat it signifies reveals how much information can be contained within an\nimage without the viewer possessing any explicit understanding of its\ncontents (such a picture is in fact better considered an early stage in the\nprocess by which such explicit understanding develops). The ancient\nalchemist* who produced the picture was dreaming, in a very real sense,\nwhile doing so\u2014dreaming about what a person could be, and how that\nmight come about.\nAt the very base of the image is a winged sphere. Atop that perches a\ndragon. Standing on the dragon is a two-headed human figure\u2014one head\nmale, the other female. The male head is associated with an image of the\nSun; the female, with the Moon. In between but also above the two heads is\nthe symbol for Mercury: god, planet, and metal, simultaneously. A variety\nof additional symbols round out the picture. Everything portrayed is\nenveloped in an egg-shaped container. This arrangement indicates that the\nimage is of many things inside one thing\u2014a multiplicity in a unity\u2014just as\nan unhatched chick is encapsulated within a single container but is many\nincreasingly differentiated and complex biological parts, particularly in its\nlater stages of development. In its entirety, the image is labeled materia\nprima\u2014Latin for the \u201cprimal element.\u201d\nThe alchemists regarded the materia prima as the fundamental substance\nfrom which everything else\u2014matter and spirit included, equally\u2014emerged,\nor was derived. You can profitably consider that primal element the\npotential we face when we confront the future, including our future selves\n\u2014or the potential we cannot help upbraiding ourselves and others for\nwasting. It can also be usefully conceptualized as the information from\nwhich we build ourselves and the world, instead of the matter out of which\nwe generally consider reality composed. Each interpretation\u2014potential and\ninformation\u2014has its advantages.\nWhat does it mean that the world can be usefully considered as potential\nor information? Think about what happens, for example, when you stop by\nthe mailbox and pick up your mail. Consider, as well, what that mail is\n\u201cmade of.\u201d Materially speaking, it is merely paper and ink. But that material\nsubstrate is essentially irrelevant. It would not matter if the message was\ndelivered by email or voice\u2014or in Morse code, for that matter. What is\nrelevant is the content. And that means that each piece of mail is a container\nof content\u2014of potential or information, positive, neutral, or negative.\nMaybe, for example, it is a notification of investigation from your country\u2019s\ntax department. This means that, despite its apparently harmless presence in\nyour hand, the letter is tightly and inextricably connected to a gigantic,\ncomplex and oft-arbitrary structure that may well not have your best\ninterests in mind. Alternatively, perhaps it is something joyful, such as an\nunexpected letter from someone loved or a long-awaited check. From such\na perspective, an envelope is a container\u2014a mysterious container, at least in\npotential\u2014from which an entire new world might emerge.\nEveryone understands this idea, even if they do not know it. If you have\nbeen having trouble with the tax authorities, for example, and you receive\nan official piece of mail from their agency, your blood pressure will\nincrease (or drop precipitously), your heart will pound, your palms will\nsweat, and a feeling of intense fear, even doom, may sweep over you. That\nis the instinctive response, associated with preparation for action, that\naccompanies exposure to danger. And now you will have to decide: are you\ngoing to open the letter and face what is \u201cinside\u201d? And, having done so, are\nyou going to think your way through the problem, terrible as that might be,\nand begin to address it? Or are you going to ignore what you now know,\npretend that everything is all right (even though you know, emotionally\u2014as\na consequence of your anxiety\u2014that it is not), and pay the inevitable\npsychological and physical price? It is the former route that will require you\nto voluntarily confront what you are afraid of\u2014the terrible, abstract\nmonster\u2014and, hypothetically, to become stronger and more integrated as a\nresult. It is the latter route that will leave the problem in its monstrous form\nand force you to suffer like a scared animal confronted by a predator\u2019s\nvicious eyes in the pitch of night.\nA winged sphere, inscribed with a square, a triangle, and the numerals 3\nand 4 occupies the bottom third of the image in question.* This singular\nentity or object was known by the alchemists as the \u201cround chaos.\u201d3\n It is a\ncontainer\u2014the initial container of the primordial element\u2014the container of\nwhat the world, and the psyche, consists of before it becomes differentiated.\nThis is the potential, or information. This is what attracts your attention\nunconsciously and compels you to attend to something before you know\nwhy it has gripped your interest. This is when and where what is new makes\nits entrance into what is predictable and certain (for better or worse); what\nflits about you, with little voluntary control\u2014as if it is something winged\u2014\nas your imagination and your attention move unpredictably but\nmeaningfully from association to association; and it is what you are looking\nat when you have no idea what it is you are confronting. Finally, it is what\nyou cannot look away from when you are possessed by horror, even as such\npotential for horror simultaneously adds vital interest to life.\nStrangely, the round chaos may be familiar to modern audiences (again,\neven if they do not know it), because of the Harry Potter series of books and\nfilms. J. K. Rowling, the series author, takes some pains to describe a\nsporting event, Quidditch, which helps to define and unify Hogwarts. The\npoint of Quidditch is to drive a ball (the Quaffle) through one of the three\nhoops guarded by the opposing team, while flying about the playing pitch\non enchanted brooms. Success in doing so gains the scorer\u2019s team 10 points.\nSimultaneously, two separate players (one from each team) play another\ngame\u2014a game within the game. Chosen for their exceptional skill in\nattention and flight, these two competitors\u2014known as Seekers\u2014attempt to\nlocate, chase, and capture a winged ball, the Snitch, which is identical in\nappearance to the round chaos that sits at the bottom of the alchemist\u2019s\nimage. The Snitch is golden\u2014indicating its exceptional value and purity*\u2014\nand zips around chaotically, at a very fast rate, darting, weaving, bobbing,\nand racing the Seekers as they pursue it astride their brooms. If a Seeker\ncaptures the Snitch, his or her team gains 150 points (typically enough to\nensure victory) and the entire game comes to an end. This indicates that\nchasing and capturing whatever is represented by the Snitch\u2014and, by\nimplication, the round chaos\u2014is a goal whose importance supersedes any\nother.* Why is Rowling\u2019s game, conjured up for us by her deep\nimagination, structured in that manner? What does her narrative idea\nsignify? There are two ways of answering these questions (although both\nanswers relate importantly to each other):\nFirst: In Rule I, we discussed the idea that the true winner of any game is\nthe person who plays fair. This is because playing fair, despite the\nparticularities of any given game, is a higher-order accomplishment than\nmere victory. Striving to play fair, in the ultimate sense\u2014following the\nspirit of the rules, as well as the letter\u2014is an indication of true personality\ndevelopment, predicated as it is on concern for true reciprocity. The Seekers\nof the Snitch must ignore the details of the game of Quidditch, of which\nthey are still a part, while attempting to find and seize the Snitch, just as the\nplayer of a real-world game must ignore the particularities of that game\nwhile attending to what constitutes truly ethical play, regardless of what is\nhappening on the playing field. Thus, the ethical player, like the Seeker,\nindomitably pursues what is most valuable in the midst of complex,\ncompeting obligations.\nSecond: Among the alchemists, the round chaos was associated with the\nwinged god Mercury, who served as messenger from the realm of the\ndivine, guide of souls to the underworld, and bringer of good fortune. It is\nfor this reason that the ancient symbol for Mercury is located at the very\npinnacle (the most important location) of the image in question. It is an\nattempt to indicate what guides the process that the picture represents.\nCenturies ago, prior to the dawn of modern chemistry, the god Mercury\nrepresented what inspires or attracts interest involuntarily. He was the spirit\nwho possessed a person when his or her attention was drawn irresistibly to\nsome person, situation, or event. Imagine that there are very complex\nprocesses going on in your mind unconsciously, highlighting events of\npotential worth and distinguishing them from everything else constantly\nunfolding around you. Imagine that those processes that distinguish value\nare alive, which is certainly the case, and that they are complex and\nintegrated enough to be conceptualized as a personality. That is Mercury.\nThe draw he exerts on our attention reveals itself in a sense of significance\n\u2014in the sense that something happening around you is worth attending to,\nor contains something of value. The Seeker\u2014in real life, as well as in\nRowling\u2019s Potter series and its Quidditch game\u2014is he or she who takes that\nsense of significance more seriously than anything else. The Seeker is\ntherefore the person who is playing the game that everyone else is playing\n(and who is disciplined and expert at the game), but who is also playing an\nadditional, higher-order game: the pursuit of what is of primary\nsignificance. The Snitch (like the round chaos) can therefore be considered\nthe \u201ccontainer\u201d of that primary significance\u2014that meaning\u2014and, therefore,\nsomething revelatory when pursued and caught. We might in this context\nremember what has come to be known as the Golden Rule: \u201cAnd as ye\nwould that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise\u201d (Luke 6:31).\nThere is nothing more important than learning to strive under difficult and\nfrustrating circumstances to play fair. This is what should be chased, so to\nspeak, during any game (even though it is also important to try to obtain\nvictory in the game).*\nEach of us, when fortunate, is compelled forward by something that\ngrips our attention\u2014love of a person; a sport; a political, sociological, or\neconomic problem, or a scientific question; a passion for art, literature, or\ndrama\u2014something that calls to us for reasons we can neither control nor\nunderstand (try to make yourself interested in something you just do not\ncare about and see how well that works). The phenomena that grip us\n(phenomena: from the Greek word phainesthai, \u201cto appear, or to be brought\nto light\u201d) are like lamps along a dark path: they are part of the unconscious\nprocesses devoted to integrating and furthering the development of our\nspirits, the furtherance of our psychological development. You do not\nchoose what interests you. It chooses you. Something manifests itself out of\nthe darkness as compelling, as worth living for; following that, something\nmoves us further down the road, to the next meaningful manifestation\u2014and\nso it goes, as we continue to seek, develop, grow, and thrive. It is a perilous\njourney, but it is also the adventure of our lives. Think of pursuing someone\nyou love: catch them or not, you change in the process. Think, as well, of\nthe traveling you have done, or of the work you have undertaken, whether\nfor pleasure or necessity. In all these cases you experience what is new.\nSometimes that is painful; sometimes it is better than anything else that has\never happened to you. Either way, it is deeply informative. It is all part of\nthe potential of the world, calling you into Being, changing you forever\u2014\nfor better or worse\u2014in consequence of your pursuit.\nAtop the round chaos perches a dragon. This is because what is\ninteresting and meaningful (and novel and unexpected, as those all go\ntogether) manifests itself in a form that is both dangerous and promising,\nparticularly when its grip is intense and irresistible. The danger is, of\ncourse, signified by the presence of the immortal, predatory reptile; the\npromise is hinted at, as a dragon archetypally guards a great treasure. Thus,\nthe drawing represents a psychological progression. First, you find yourself\ninterested in something. That something (the round chaos) contains or is\ncomposed of potential, or information. If it is pursued and caught, it\nreleases that information. Out of that information we build the world we\nperceive, and we build ourselves as perceivers. Thus, the round chaos is the\ncontainer from which both matter (the world) and spirit (our psyches)\nemerge. There is some numerological indication of this on the spherical\nbody of the round chaos itself: the number 3, accompanied by a triangle,\nwhich is traditionally associated with spirit (because of its association with\nthe Holy Trinity), and the number 4, associated with the world of matter\n(because of its association with the four traditional elements: earth, water,\nwind, and fire). The dragon, in turn, perched on top of the round chaos,\nrepresents the danger and possibility of the information within.\nAtop the dragon stands a figure known as a Rebis, a single body with\ntwo heads, one male, one female. The Rebis is a symbol of the fully\ndeveloped personality that can emerge from forthright and courageous\npursuit of what is meaningful (the round chaos) and dangerous and\npromising (the dragon). It has a symbolically masculine aspect, which\ntypically stands for exploration, order, and rationality (indicated by the Sun,\nwhich can be seen to the left of the male head), and a symbolically feminine\naspect, which stands for chaos, promise, care, renewal, and emotion\n(indicated by the Moon, to the right of the female). In the course of normal\nsocialization, it is typical for one of these aspects to become more\ndeveloped than the other (as males are socialized in the male manner, to\nwhich they are also inclined biologically, and females in the female\nmanner). Nonetheless, it is possible\u2014with enough exploration, enough\nexposure to the round chaos and the dragon\u2014to develop both elements.\nThat constitutes an ideal\u2014or so goes the alchemical intuition.\nOut of the unknown\u2014the potential that makes up the world\u2014comes the\nterrible but promising form of the dragon, peril and promise united. It is an\neternal dichotomy echoed by the presence of the two remaining symbols to\nthe right and above the dragon\u2019s tail: Jupiter, representing the positive, and\nSaturn, the negative. Out of the confrontation with peril and promise\nemerges the masculine and feminine aspects of the psyche, working\ntogether in harmony. Guiding the process is the spirit Mercurius,\nmanifesting itself as meaning in the world, working through unconscious\nmeans to attract exploration to what will unite the various discordant and\nwarring elements of the personality. This can all be read, appropriately, as a\nstory of the development of the ideal personality\u2014an attempt, in image, to\ndescribe what each of us could be.\n            ",

            "content": "\nNow we are going to attempt a description of \u201cwho you could be\u201d from\nanother perspective, taken from one of the earliest stories we have been\nfortunate enough to rediscover. In the ancient Mesopotamian Enuma Elish\n(translation: When on High) we have the oldest near-complete hero myth\nknown, estimated at four thousand years of age in its written form and, no\ndoubt, far older as an oral tradition. The story begins when the primordial\ngoddess Tiamat, embodiment of salt water (as well as a monstrous aquatic\ndragon), enters into sexual union with her equally primordial male consort,\nApsu, the embodiment of fresh water. This union gives rise to the initial\nrealm of being, inhabited by the elder gods, the first children of Tiamat and\nApsu.\nTo understand the beginning of this story, we need to know a few things\nthe ancients held to be fundamentally true. These are markedly different\nfrom the truths of modern science. Before the dawn of the scientific\nworldview, a mere six hundred years ago, reality was construed as all that\nwhich human beings experience. That which we experience can be\ndistinguished, conceptually, from reality as objective world\u2014pure physical\nbeing\u2014by its more comprehensive contents, which include subjective\nexperiences such as emotions, dreams, visions, and motivational states such\nas hunger, thirst, and pain. That which we experience is better compared to\na novel or a movie, which concentrates on the communication and sharing\nof subjective as well as objective states, than is reality as objective world,\nwhich we might liken to a scientific description of physical reality. It is the\nactual, particular, and unique demise of someone you love, for example,\ncompared to the listing of that death in the hospital records. It is the drama\nof lived experience. It is because our own experience is genuinely literary,\nnarrative, embodied, and storylike that we are so attracted to fictional\nrepresentations. Movies, plays, operas, TV dramas\u2014even the lyrics of\nsongs\u2014help us deal with our lived experiences, which are something\ndifferent and broader than the mere material from which our experience\nhypothetically rises.\nEngaging with the first part of the Enuma Elish requires us to understand\na second fundamental realization of the ancients: the fundamentally social\nnature of our cognitive categories. That is why everything is personified in\nchildren\u2019s books: the Sun, the Moon, toys, animals\u2014even machines. We see\nnothing strange in this, because it so profoundly mirrors our perceptual\ntendencies. We expect children to view and understand the world in this\nmanner, and we can easily fall back into doing so ourselves. Something\nshould be clarified here: It is not truly accurate to state that the reality\nportrayed in children\u2019s fiction is personified. It is the case, instead (and this\nis a genuine reversal of the presumption in question), that we directly and\nnaturally perceive reality as personified, and then must work very diligently\nto strip that personification away, so that we can detect \u201cobjective reality.\u201d*\nWe understand reality, therefore, as if it is constructed of personalities. That\nis because so much of what we encounter in our hypersocial reality, our\ncomplex societies, is in fact personality\u2014and gendered personality, at that,\nreflecting the billion years or so since the emergence of sexual reproduction\n(ample time for its existence to have profoundly structured our perceptions).\nWe understand male, and abstract from that the masculine. We understand\nfemale, and abstract from that the feminine. Finally, we understand the\nchild, and abstract from that, most commonly, the son. These basic\ndivisions are clearly reflected in the creation story of the Enuma Elish, just\nas they are reflected in, or more accurately underpin, our understanding of\nthe stories we all know.\nTiamat, the primordial goddess, is chaos, a female monster, a dragon.\nShe is the terror of nature, creative and destructive, mother and slayer of us\nall. Apsu, her husband, is the eternal father. He is the order that we depend\nupon for security, and by which we are simultaneously tyrannized.* These\ntwo most primal of deities come together in a productive, sexual union,\n\u201cmingling their waters,\u201d in the ancient words. In this fashion, they produce\ntheir first progeny, the elder gods of Mesopotamia. These gods represent\nelements of the world more differentiated than the primordial mother and\nfather\u2014such as heaven and earth, mud and silt, and war and fire.*\nHowever, they are also careless, noisy, and impulsive as two-year-old\nchildren (who are, after all, primal forces in their own right). Their\ncontinual ceaseless, thoughtless activity and general unconsciousness\nculminates in a catastrophe: their mutual decision to wage war upon and\nthen slay Apsu, and consequent attempt to build a stable dwelling place on\nhis corpse.\nTiamat\u2014chaos itself\u2014already irritated by the brainless racket of her\nchildren, is murderously enraged by the heedless slaughter of her husband.\nThe Terrible Goddess builds an army of eleven monsters to deal with her\nwayward offspring, placing a demonic figure named Kingu, whom she\ntakes as a second husband, at their head, and delivering to him the Tablet of\nDestinies (indicating his authority as ultimate ruler of the universe). The\nrelationship between this brilliant dramatic representation and how we use,\nor misuse, the gifts of our culture is obvious: the careless demolition of\ntradition is the invitation to the (re)emergence of chaos. When ignorance\ndestroys culture, monsters will emerge.\nWhile Tiamat busily arranges her army, the elder gods continue their\nactivity, pairing off, producing children, and then grandchildren, of their\nown. One of the latter, Marduk, appears particularly talented, powerful, and\npromising. He is born with eyes encircling his head. He can see\neverywhere. He can speak magic words. He is something entirely new\u2014\nand this is noted early by his progenitors. While Marduk matures, the elder\ngods are compelled to confront Tiamat, with whom they are now at war.\nOne after another they attempt to defeat her. All return in abject failure.\nFinally, someone suggests that Marduk, though still young, should be sent\nto confront his terrible grandmother. Approached with this idea, he agrees,\nbut only on the condition that he is awarded the right, henceforth\u2014if he is\nvictorious\u2014to hold the Tablet of Destinies, and sit atop the dominance\nhierarchy of the gods.\nIt is in this manner that this ancient story describes the emergence of\nmonotheism out of polytheism. The Enuma Elish appears to be a\ndramatized account of the psychological or spiritual processes comprising\nthis transformation. The ancient Mesopotamian civilization faced the\nnecessity of incorporating and unifying many diverse tribes and peoples,\neach of whom had their own gods. The god who arose out of the conflict\nbetween all those gods (\u201cWhose god is supreme?\u201d) was, therefore, a metagod\u2014a god composed of what was most important about all gods. It was\nfor such a reason, for example, that fifty different names characterized\nMarduk. This emergence of one from many is a very common process,\ndescribed by the scholar of myth Mircea Eliade as the war of the gods in\nheaven, a typical mythological motif, as well as alluded to earlier.* It is the\npsychological counterpart, in the world of imagination, to the genuine\nstruggle of concepts of divinity and value on earth. Tribes unite. Each has\nits gods. The people comprising these multitudinous groups go to war,\nconcretely and conceptually, for what they believe\u2014sometimes for\ngenerations. It is as if the gods they follow were battling for dominance\nover periods exceeding single human lives, using their followers as proxies.\nThat is reflected in the ancient stories. If and when the gods come to an\nagreement about their relative positions\u2014more particularly, if they arrange\nthemselves into a hierarchy\u2014it means that peace has genuinely been\nestablished, because peace is the establishment of a shared hierarchy of\ndivinity, of value. Thus, an eternal question emerges whenever people of\ndifferent backgrounds are required to deal with one another on a relatively\npermanent basis: What do all gods share that makes them gods? What is\nGod, in essence?\nThat is a very difficult question. It is, on the one hand, the question of\nvalue: What is of the highest importance? It is, on the other hand, the\nquestion of sovereignty: What principle should rule? These are the\nquestions posed by those pondering the ultimate source of divine\nsignificance itself. Their difficulty meant that they, and by extension the\nquestion of God, had to be answered over centuries, over millennia. The\nanswer emerged first in story form. The Mesopotamians brilliantly intuited\nthat the highest god\u2014the highest good\u2014involved careful attention (the\nmultiple, head-circling eyes of Marduk) and effective language (the magic\nwords of Marduk, capable of generating a cosmos), in addition to the\ncourage and strength to voluntarily confront and overcome chaos, the\nunknown. It could be argued that these are the defining features of the great\ncentral spirit of mankind, at least insofar as that spirit is noble and\nadmirable.\nThe ancient Egyptians formulated an idea similar in many important\nregards\u2014which we will discuss later in detail\u2014associating their savior-god\nHorus, son of Osiris, with the sharp-eyed falcon, and identifying him with\nthe vision willing to search out, detect, understand, and defeat evil\n(symbolized with the famous Egyptian image of the single eye).\nRepresenting that reality\u2014pay attention, above all, even to what is\nmonstrous and malevolent, and speak wisely and truthfully\u2014could be the\nsingle most important accomplishment of our species.4\n It allows us to\napprehend in dramatic form the fundamental necessity of coming to grips\nwith what our senses demonstrate to us, no matter how terrifying the reality\nrevealed. It allows for the possibility of bringing our explicit understanding\ncloser in line with our deepest being, making possible a truer union of body\nand spirit through the partial comprehension and imitation of the story.\nMost importantly, perhaps, it allows us to realize the immense importance\nof words in transforming potential into actuality, and helps us understand\nthat the role we each play in that transformation is in some vital sense akin\nto the divine.\nAfter his election to the highest of places, Marduk challenges Tiamat\ndirectly, encloses her, defeated, in a giant net, and cuts her into pieces,\nfashioning the heavens and the earth from her remains. One of Marduk\u2019s\nmany names is, in fact, \u201che who makes ingenious things as a consequence\nof the conflict with Tiamat.\u201d5\n It might be noted, in this regard, that tens of\nthousands of years ago, men literally did construct the habitable world out\nof the pieces of monsters, making their early dwellings from the giant bones\nof animals they had so courageously speared.6\n Marduk simultaneously\ndefeats his grandmother\u2019s monstrous army, including the leader, Kingu,\nfrom whom he takes the Tablet of Destinies, confirming his place as\nsupreme leader of the cosmos. Then he returns home, enemies in tow. His\ncompatriots celebrate his victory and accede yet more completely to his\nleadership, before he assigns them their various duties. Then, after\nconsulting Ea, the god of wisdom, Marduk determines to create man, to aid\nthe gods most fundamentally in the eternal task of maintaining the proper\nbalance between order and chaos\u2014to release those very gods from their\nservice, and to transfer their burden onto our all-too-human shoulders.*\nThe basic story is this: when order (Apsu) is carelessly threatened or\ndestroyed, the terrible forces of chaos from which the world was originally\nderived appear once again in their most destructive, monstrous, predatory\nguise. Then a hero, representing the highest of values, must arise or be\nelected to confront this chaotic force. He does so successfully, deriving or\nproducing something of great worth. What the hero represents is the most\nimportant of the great forces that make up the human psyche. To think of it\nanother way: the hero is the embodied principle of action and perception\nthat must rule over all the primordial psychological elements of lust, rage,\nhunger, thirst, terror, and joy. For chaos to remain effectively at bay (or,\neven better, tamed and therefore harnessed), this heroic principle must be\nregarded as the most important of all things that can organize and motivate\nmankind. This means, at least, that it must be continually acted out, which\nis what \u201cregarded as important\u201d actually means. It is in this way that the\nspirit of Marduk still possesses each individual who engages courageously\nin the processes of encounter and confrontation that eternally create and\nrenew society. It is this that happens when each small child learns to\nregulate and unite his emotions and motivations into a coherent personality,\nand then goes out to challenge the unknown world.\nIn slightly altered form, this is the story of St. George: The inhabitants of\nan ancient city must obtain water from a well beside the nest of a dragon.\nTo do so, however, they have to offer the dragon some sacrifice\u2014a sheep,\nunder most circumstances, but a maiden, if no sheep can be found. The\nyoung women of the city draw lots when the supply of sheep is exhausted.\nOne day it is the daughter of the king herself who loses. St. George appears,\nconfronts the dragon with the sign of the cross\u2014symbol of the eternal\nRedeemer, the archetypal hero\u2014and frees the doomed princess. The city\u2019s\ninhabitants then convert to Christianity. Victory over the dragon\u2014the\npredator, as such, the ruler of unexplored territory\u2014is victory over all the\nforces that have threatened the individual and society, over evolutionary and\nhistorical spans of time, as well as the more abstract evil we all still face,\nwithout and within. The cross, for its part, is the burden of life. It is a place\nof betrayal, torture, and death. It is therefore a fundamental symbol of\nmortal vulnerability. In the Christian drama, it is also the place where\nvulnerability is transcended, as a consequence of its acceptance. This\nvoluntary acceptance is also equivalent to victory over the dragon,\nrepresentation of chaos, death, and the unknown. By accepting life\u2019s\nsuffering, therefore, evil may be overcome. The alternative is hell, at least\nin its psychological form: rage, resentment, and the desire for revenge and\ndestruction.\nThe same story is echoed in the tales of St. Patrick, who chases the\nsnakes out of Ireland, and St. Michael, who defeats the Christian equivalent\nof Kingu, \u201cthat ancient serpent called the devil\u201d (Revelation 12:9). This is\nthe same story recounted by J. R. R. Tolkien in The Hobbit, which was in\nturn derived from the ancient poem Beowulf, the tale of a hero defeating a\npair of intelligent monsters\u2014son, and then worse, mother.\n7\n In The Hobbit,\nthe hero develops character and wisdom (as a thief, strangely enough)\nduring his quest to help discover the ancient treasure hoarded by the dragon.\nThe story of Perseus and Medusa, whose visage was so terrible that it\nturned onlookers to stone, is another variant, as is Pinocchio, who rescues\nhis father from a subaquatic monster, and dies and is reborn while doing so.\nSomething similar is portrayed in the first of the recent Avengers movies, in\nwhich Iron Man\u2014the man who has transformed himself into a partly\ngolden superhero\u2014defeats the alien dragon worms of the Chitauri (allied\nwith the satanic Loki). He then dies, is reborn, and gets the maiden (in the\nnonswooning guise of Ms. Pepper Potts). It must be understood: Such\nstories would not even be comprehensible (not least to children, as well as\nadults) if our evolutionary history had importantly differed, and if our entire\nculture had not been shaped, implicitly and explicitly, by these ancient\npatterns.\nAll these heroes act out what was perhaps the greatest discovery ever\nmade by man\u2019s primordial ancestors: if you have the vision and the courage\n(and a good stout stick, when necessary), you can chase away the worst of\nsnakes. No doubt the greatest of our ancestors were beginning to threaten\nsnakes with sticks when we still lived in trees. No doubt it was those\nvoluntarily snake-chasing ancestors who reaped the benefits of their bravery\nin the form of nearby grateful maidens (or their ancestral arboreal\nequivalents)\u2014and perhaps this is why dragons hoard virgins, as well as\ngold. What constitutes the worst of all snakes and the stoutest of all sticks,\nhowever, might be regarded as the central religious questions of humanity.\nIt is interesting to note that in The Hobbit, the worst snake is \u201conly\u201d a\ndragon, but in The Lord of the Rings, the worst snake, so to speak, is the\nmuch more abstract evil of the wizard Sauron. As humanity became more\nsophisticated in its capacity to abstract, we increasingly appreciated the fact\nthat predatory monsters can come in many guises, only some of which are\nanimal in their form. Literature of an arguably more sophisticated form\nendlessly echoes this realization.\n            ",

            "content": "\nIn the second volume of J. K. Rowling\u2019s fantasy series, Harry Potter and\nthe Chamber of Secrets, the castle of Hogwarts is threatened by strange,\nchaotic forces, due to the earlier and ongoing misbehavior of several\npowerful adult wizards (as established in volume one). Now, it is significant\nthat Harry is orphaned: it is an integral part of the heroic pattern. He has his\nearthly parents, the thick and conventional Dursleys, willfully blind,\nshortsighted, and terribly overprotective of (and, therefore, tragically\ndangerous to) Dudley, their unfortunate but predictably self-centered and\nbullying natural son. But Harry has his heavenly parents, too, his true\nmother and father\u2014symbolically, Nature and Culture (variants of chaos and\norder). They exist as part of his intrinsically magical potential\u2014the magical\npotential of all of us, in fact, as we are all children of Nature and Culture,\nwith the tremendous potential that implies, as well as the more mundane\noffspring of our particular parents.8\nWhen Harry returns to Hogwarts after his summer vacation, he can\ndetect strange and ominous noises emanating from somewhere in the\nbuilding. At the same time, various students and residents of Hogwarts are\nfound paralyzed\u2014turned to stone\u2014in diverse locations around the building.\nTurned to stone: What could that possibly mean? It certainly means to be\nunable to move\u2014but it also signifies something deeper. It means to be\nhunted; to become a rabbit confronted by a wolf; to become the horrified\nand awestruck object of the predatory gaze. Many herbivores,\ncomparatively defenseless, facing imminent and brutal death, freeze in\nplace, paralyzed by fear, depending on camouflage and immobility to\nrender them invisible to the terrible intentions of nearby red-toothed and\nrazor-clawed carnivores. Predatory, reptilian forms still particularly have\nthat effect on human beings (hence our awed fascination, for example, with\ndinosaurs). But to have no more courage than a rabbit is definitely not to be\neverything you could be.\nEventually Harry learns that the force turning his friends into stone is a\ngigantic snake, a basilisk, whose gaze exerts a paralyzing force. He\ndiscovers that this serpent is continually slithering around the very\nfoundation of Hogwarts, in the immense waterworks that serve the great\ncastle. This basilisk is an analog to the great dragon faced by Beowulf, hero\nof the thousand-year-old story that served as pattern for Tolkien\u2019s\nadventures, perhaps the twentieth century\u2019s closest cousins to J. K.\nRowling\u2019s extensive fantasy. It is, as well, the great devouring shark of the\nmovie Jaws, lurking in the black water of night, ready at a moment\u2019s notice\nto pull the naked and unwary below; the fragility of our homes and our\ninstitutions, which can collapse and leave us stripped of their protective\nwalls in a single terrible moment; and more comprehensively, the\nunderworld of the ancients, whose doors gape open when everything\npredictable collapses. At the deepest of levels, this is the chaos and\npotential that continually lurks under the order of our familiar worlds,\npsychological and social.\nAfter much searching, Harry gains entrance to this underworld labyrinth\nof pipes and tunnels, and finds the central chamber. He does this,\nsignificantly, through the sewer, acting out the ancient alchemical dictum, in\nsterquilinis invenitur: in filth it will be found.* What does this mean? That\nwhich you most need to find will be found where you least wish to look.*\nThere, underground, Ginny (Virgin-ia), his best friend\u2019s sister and Harry\u2019s\neventual serious romantic interest, lies unconscious. She is the maiden\u2014or\nthe anima, the soul\u2014forever incarcerated by the dragon, as in the tale of St.\nGeorge. It is up to Harry, orphaned hero, to wake and rescue her (just as\nTolkien\u2019s Bilbo helps take the gold from the terrible Smaug; just as\nDisney\u2019s Prince Phillip rescues Sleeping Beauty\u2014both rescuing what is\nmost valuable from the clutches of a great dragon).*\nAnd of course, the unknown is a great predator\u2014the basilisk Harry faces\n\u2014and of course, that predator guards a great treasure, gold beyond measure\nor the sleeping virgin, because the individual brave enough to voluntarily\nbeard the serpent in his lair is most likely to gain access to the untold riches\nthat exist in potential, awaiting us in the adventure of our life, away from\nsecurity and what is currently known. Who dares wins*\u2014if he does not\nperish. And who wins also makes himself irresistibly desirable and\nattractive, not least because of the development of character that adventure\ninevitably produces. And this is what makes us forever more than rabbits.\nAnd Harry, like Bilbo, can only manage this\u2014can only perceive the\nserpent, when it is invisible to everyone else\u2014because he has a dark side.\nTolkien\u2019s Bilbo must become a thief before he can become a hero. He must\nincorporate his monstrousness, so that he can supersede his naive\nharmlessness, before he is tough enough to face the terrors that confront\nhim. Harry is touched by evil in another manner, as part of the\nincomparably dark wizard Voldemort\u2019s soul is embedded within him\n(although neither he nor Voldemort are initially aware of this). It is for this\nreason that the young wizard can speak with and hear (that is, perceive)\nsnakes. It is in keeping with this that he is disciplined and courageous, but\nalso willing and ready to break the rules when necessary.\nWhile in the bowels of Hogwarts, Harry comes under attack by the\nbasilisk, which is under the control of Voldemort. Voldemort therefore bears\nthe same relationship to the basilisk in Hogwarts as Satan does, strangely\nand incomprehensibly, to the vision-granting serpent in the Genesis story of\nthe Garden of Eden. Why might this be? It could be said\u2014and should be\u2014\nthat one form of serpentine chaos and danger is the threat of the reptilian\npredator itself. But another form, more abstract\u2014more psychological, more\nspiritual\u2014is human evil: the danger we pose to one another. At some point\nin our evolutionary and cultural history, we began to understand that human\nevil could rightly be considered the greatest of all snakes. So, the symbolic\nprogression might be (1) snake as evil predator, then (2) external human\nenemy as snake/evil/predator, then (3) subjective, personal, or\npsychological darkness/vengefulness/deceit as snake/evil/predator. Each of\nthese representations, which took untold centuries, perhaps millennia to\nconceptualize, constitute a tangible increase in the sophistication of the\nimage of evil.9\nAll such manifestations of serpentine chaos and danger are apparently\nstill first detected, processed, and symbolically interassociated by the\nancient brain systems that evolved to protect us from predatory reptiles.10\nAnd freezing\u2014prompted by those systems\u2014solves the problem now,\nmaybe, by hiding the individual who is currently being preyed upon, but it\nleaves the predator alive for tomorrow. Instead, the danger must be hunted\ndown and destroyed\u2014and even that is too concrete to constitute a\npermanent solution to the problem of evil itself (rather than a solution to\nany particular exemplar of evil). Most profoundly and abstractly\n(paralleling the idea that the greatest predator, the greatest snake, is the evil\nthat lurks within), evil\u2019s destruction manifests as the life of virtue that\nconstrains malevolence in its most abstracted and comprehensive form. It is\nfor this reason, for example, that the Disney prince Phillip of Sleeping\nBeauty fame is armed for his conflict with the great Dragon of Chaos by\nbenevolent Nature (in the form of the feminine fairies that accompany him\nand aid in his escape from Maleficent, the Evil Queen) with the Sword of\nTruth and Shield of Virtue.\nHarry directly confronts the basilisk, down in the Chamber of Secrets,\ndeep below the wizarding castle, but is cornered and in great peril. At that\npropitious moment, a phoenix kept by the wise headmaster of Hogwarts\narrives, provides the young hero with a sword, and then attacks the giant\nsnake, providing Harry with time to regroup. Harry slays the basilisk with\nthe weapon, but is fatally bitten in the process. This is another deep\nmythological echo: In the story of Genesis, for example, the encounter with\nthe snake proves fatal to man and woman alike, who become aware of their\nfragility and inevitable death soon after they awaken and gain vision. It is\nalso a harsh truth: predators devour, dragons lay waste, chaos destroys. The\nthreat is real. Even truth, virtue, and courage are not necessarily enough, but\nthey are our best bet. And sometimes a little death is the medication\nnecessary to forestall death itself. Fortunately, the phoenix has magical,\nrevivifying tears, which it cries into Harry\u2019s wounds. Thus, the young\nwizard revives, defeats Voldemort (a much more challenging task than\nmerely overcoming the gargantuan serpent), rescues Ginny, and saves the\nschool.\nIt is with the introduction of the phoenix to the story of St. George that\nRowling reveals another element of her intuitive genius. The phoenix is a\nfowl that can die and be reborn forever. It has, therefore, throughout the\nages, been a symbol of Christ, with whom the magical bird shares many\nfeatures. It is also, equally, that element of the individual human personality\nthat must die and regenerate, as it learns, painfully, through the oft-tragic\nexperience that destroys previous certainty, replacing it first with doubt, and\nthen\u2014when successfully confronted\u2014with new and more complete\nknowledge. A voluntary death-and-rebirth transformation\u2014the change\nnecessary to adapt when terrible things emerge\u2014is therefore a solution to\nthe potentially fatal rigidity of erroneous certainty, excessive order, and\nstultification.\n            ",

When they imitate, they use their\nbodies to represent the bodies of others. But this imitation is not mindless,\nautomatized mimicry. It is instead the ability to identify regularities or\npatterns in the behavior of other people, and then to imitate those patterns.\nWhen a young girl plays at being a mother, for example, she does not\nduplicate, gesture for gesture, what she has previously observed of her\nmother\u2019s actions.

If you observed many little girls, acting out many mothers, you could\nderive a very good idea of what \u201cmother\u201d meant, in its purest form, even if\nyou had never seen an actual mother. If you were good with words, then\nperhaps you could describe the essential elements of maternal behavior and\ntransmit them. You might do that best in the form of a story.\nIt is easier and more direct to represent a behavioral pattern with\nbehavior than with words. Outright mimicry does that directly, action for\naction. Imitation, which can produce new behaviors akin to those that\nmotivated the mimicry, takes that one step further. Drama\u2014formalized\nimitation, enacted upon a stage\u2014is precisely behavior portraying behavior,\nbut distilled ever closer to the essence. Literature takes that transmission\none more difficult step, portraying action in the imagination of the writer\nand the reader, in the complete absence of both real actors and a material\nstage. It is only the greatest of storytellers who can manage that\ntransformation, representing the greatest and most vitally necessary of acts\nin the most interesting, profound, and memorable words. Generations of\ngreat storytellers, retelling, modifying, and editing great stories, therefore\nend up jointly creating the greatest of stories. Once cultures become literate\n(something that has happened only recently, from the historical\nperspective), those stories can be written down. It is at this point, roughly,\nthat myth and ritual might be said to transform themselves into religion.\nThe imitation and communication of the greatest, most memorable acts\nnecessitates distillation and communication of the patterns of the deepest\nwisdom of mankind. If a great and memorable act is one undertaken by a\nparticularly admirable individual, a local hero, then the greatest and most\nmemorable acts possible would be those undertaken by the spirit (embodied\nin part by particular individuals) who exemplified what all local heroes\neverywhere have in common. That hero of heroes\u2014that meta-hero\u2014would\nhave to exist, logically, in turn, in a place that was common across all\nplaces requiring heroism. That place might be regarded as a meta-world\u2014\neven though it is real, even hyperreal (that is, more real in its abstraction\nacross places than our direct perceptions of a given, singular time or place).\nIt is precisely this hyperreal meta-world that consists of the continual\ninteractions between chaos and order, which eternally serve as the\nbattleground between good and evil characterizing the hero. The undying\npattern that hero embodies, in turn\u2014upon whose actions the individual and\nsociety both depend\u2014is the highest of all Gods. He is both child of and\nmediator between those twin forces, transforming chaos into habitable order\n(as well as recasting order into chaos, so that it can be renewed, when it has\nbecome anachronistic and corrupt), as well as battling mightily so that good\nmight prevail.\nEveryone requires a story to structure their perceptions and actions in\nwhat would otherwise be the overwhelming chaos of being. Every story\nrequires a starting place that is not good enough and an ending place that is\nbetter. Nothing can be judged in the absence of that end place, that higher\nvalue. Without it, everything sinks into meaninglessness and boredom or\ndegenerates and spirals into terror, anxiety, and pain. But, as time changes\nall things inexorably, every specific, value-predicated story may fail, in its\nparticular incarnation and locale, and need replacement by something\nnewer, more complete, but different. In consequence, the actor of a given\nstory (and, therefore, someone deeply affiliated with the plot and the\ncharacterization) still must bow to the spirit of creative transformation that\noriginally created and may need to destroy and re-create that story. It is for\nthis reason that spirit eternally transcends dogma, truth transcends\npresupposition, Marduk transcends the elder gods, creativity updates\nsociety, and Christ transcends the law (as does Harry Potter, along with his\ncourageous but continually rule-breaking friends). But it is important to\nremember, as we discussed in Rule I: Those who break the rules ethically\nare those who have mastered them first and disciplined themselves to\nunderstand the necessity of those rules, and break them in keeping with the\nspirit rather than the letter of the law.\nThe second volume of Rowling\u2019s series proposes that predatory evil can\nbe overcome by the soul willing to die and be reborn. The complete series\nends with a creatively transformed repetition of the same message. The\nanalogy with Christianity is obvious, and the message, in essence, the same:\nThe soul willing to transform, as deeply as necessary, is the most effective\nenemy of the demonic serpents of ideology and totalitarianism, in their\npersonal and social forms. The healthy, dynamic, and above all else truthful\npersonality will admit to error. It will voluntarily shed\u2014let die\u2014outdated\nperceptions, thoughts, and habits, as impediments to its further success and\ngrowth. This is the soul that will let its old beliefs burn away, often\npainfully, so that it can live again, and move forward, renewed. This is also\nthe soul that will transmit what it has learned during that process of death\nand rebirth, so that others can be reborn along with it.\nAim at something. Pick the best target you can currently conceptualize.\nStumble toward it. Notice your errors and misconceptions along the way,\nface them, and correct them. Get your story straight. Past, present, future\u2014\nthey all matter. You need to map your path. You need to know where you\nwere, so that you do not repeat the mistakes of the past. You need to know\nwhere you are, or you will not be able to draw a line from your starting\npoint to your destination. You need to know where you are going, or you\nwill drown in uncertainty, unpredictability, and chaos, and starve for hope\nand inspiration. For better or worse, you are on a journey. You are having an\nadventure\u2014and your map better be accurate. Voluntarily confront what\nstands in your way. The way\u2014that is the path of life, the meaningful path\nof life, the straight and narrow path that constitutes the very border between\norder and chaos, and the traversing of which brings them into balance.\nAim at something profound and noble and lofty. If you can find a better\npath along the way, once you have started moving forward, then switch\ncourse. Be careful, though; it is not easy to discriminate between changing\npaths and simply giving up. (One hint: if the new path you see forward,\nafter learning what you needed to learn along your current way, appears\nmore challenging, then you can be reasonably sure that you are not deluding\nor betraying yourself when you change your mind.) In this manner, you will\nzigzag forward. It is not the most efficient way to travel, but there is no real\nalternative, given that your goals will inevitably change while you pursue\nthem, as you learn what you need to learn while you are disciplining\nyourself.\nYou will then find yourself turning across time, incrementally and\ngracefully, to aim ever more accurately at that tiny pinpoint, the X that\nmarks the spot, the bull\u2019s-eye, and the center of the cross; to aim at the\nhighest value of which you can conceive. You will pursue a target that is\nboth moving and receding: moving, because you do not have the wisdom to\naim in the proper direction when you first take aim; receding, because no\nmatter how close you come to perfecting what you are currently practicing,\nnew vistas of possible perfection will open up in front of you. Discipline\nand transformation will nonetheless lead you inexorably forward. With will\nand luck, you will find a story that is meaningful and productive, improves\nitself with time, and perhaps even provides you with more than a few\nmoments of satisfaction and joy. With will and luck, you will be the hero of\nthat story, the disciplined sojourner, the creative transformer, and the\nbenefactor of your family and broader society.\nImagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.\n            ",

He is extremely stable\nemotionally\u2014one of those tough or fortunate people (perhaps a little of\nboth) who can let the trials and tribulations of life roll off him and keep\nmoving forward with little complaint and plenty of competence. He is an\nold guy now, Dell Roberts\u2014eighty-eight. He has had a knee replaced, and\nis planning to get the remaining one done. He has had stents inserted into\nhis coronary arteries and a heart valve replaced. He suffers from drop foot\nand sometimes slips and falls because of it. But he was still curling a year\nago, pushing the heavy granite rock down the ice with a stick specifically\ndesigned for people who can no longer crouch down as easily as they once\ncould.\nWhen his wife, Beth, now deceased, developed dementia at a relatively\nyoung age, he took care of her in as uncomplaining and unresentful a\nmanner as anyone could imagine. It was impressive. I am by no means\nconvinced that I could have fared as well. He cared for her right to the point\nwhere it became impossible for him to lift her out of whatever chair she had\nsettled into. This was long after she had lost the ability to speak. But it was\nobvious by the way her eyes lit up when he entered the room that she still\nloved him\u2014and the feeling was mutual. I would not describe him as\nsomeone who is prone to avoidance when the going gets tough. Quite the\ncontrary.\nWhen Dell was a much younger man, he was for several decades a real\nestate dealer in Fairview, Alberta\u2014the small town where I grew up (we\nlived right across the street from the Roberts family, in fact). During that\ntime, he habitually went home for lunch, in accordance with the general\ncustom. Beth typically prepared him soup (probably Campbell\u2019s, which\neveryone ate at that time\u2014\u201cM\u2019m! M\u2019m! Good!\u201d), and a sandwich. One day,\nwithout warning, he snapped at his wife: \u201cWhy in the world do we always\neat off these tiny plates? I hate eating off these tiny plates!\u201d\nShe had been serving the sandwiches on bread-and-butter plates, which\naverage about six or seven inches in diameter, instead of full-size dinner\nplates of ten to twelve inches. She related this story to her daughters, soon\nafter, in a state of mild shock. This story has been retold to much laughter at\nfamily gatherings many times since. After all, she had been serving him\nlunch on those plates for at least twenty years by the time he finally said\nanything. She had no idea that he was annoyed by her table settings. He had\nnever objected. And there is something inexhaustibly amusing about that.\nNow, it is possible that he was irritated by something else altogether that\nday and did not really care about the plates. And in one sense, it is a trivial\nissue. But seen another way, it is not trivial at all, for two reasons. First, if\nsomething happens every day, it is important, and lunch was happening\nevery day. In consequence, if there was something about it that was\nchronically bothersome, even in a minor sort of way, it needed to be\nattended to. Second, it is very common to allow so-called minor irritations\n(which are not minor, as I said, if they happen constantly) to continue for\nyears without comment or resolution.\nHere is the problem: Collect a hundred, or a thousand, of those, and your\nlife is miserable and your marriage doomed. Do not pretend you are happy\nwith something if you are not, and if a reasonable solution might, in\nprinciple, be negotiated. Have the damn fight. Unpleasant as that might be\nin the moment, it is one less straw on the camel\u2019s back. And that is\nparticularly true for those daily events that everyone is prone to regard as\ntrivial\u2014even the plates on which you eat your lunch. Life is what repeats,\nand it is worth getting what repeats right.\n            ",

            "content": "\nHere is a more serious story of the same type. I had a client who had come\nto see me about her plans to move to private practice after many years as an\naccountant with a large corporation. She was well respected in her\nprofession, and was a competent, kind, and careful person. But she was also\nvery unhappy. I presumed initially that her unhappiness stemmed from\nanxiety about her career transition. But she managed that move without a\nhitch during the time we continued our sessions, while other issues rose to\nthe forefront.\nHer problem was not her career change. It was her marriage. She\ndescribed her husband as extraordinarily self-centered and simultaneously\noverly concerned with how he appeared in the eyes of others. It was a\ncontradictory combination, in some manner, although it is common enough\nto see this touching of opposites in a personality: If you lean too far in one\ndirection, something else in you leans equally far in the other. So, despite\nthe husband\u2019s narcissism (at least from his wife\u2019s perspective), he was in\nthrall to the opinions of everyone he met\u2014excepting the members of his\nown family. He also drank too much\u2014a habit which exaggerated his\ntemperamental defects.\nMy client was not comfortable in her own home. She did not feel there\nwas anything truly of her within the apartment she shared with her husband\n(the couple had no children). Her situation provided a good example of how\nwhat is outside can profoundly reflect what is inside (which is why I\nsuggest to people who are in psychological trouble that they might begin\ntheir recovery by cleaning up\u2014and then beautifying, if possible\u2014their\nrooms). All their household furnishings, which she described as showy,\nornate, and uncomfortable, had been chosen by her husband. Furthermore,\nhe avidly collected 1960s and 70s pop art, and the walls of the house were\ncrowded with these items, which he had spent time seeking out in galleries\nand otherwise gathering for many years, often while she sat waiting outside\nin the car.\nShe told me that she did not care about the furnishings and the excess of\ndecorative objects, but that was not really true. What was true was that she\ndid not care for them\u2014not a bit. Neither the showiness nor the furnishings\nnor the plethora of art works that made up her husband\u2019s collection\nappealed to her taste. She tended toward a minimalist aesthetic (or perhaps\nthat preference was a consequence of her husband\u2019s decorative excesses). It\nwas never quite clear what she might have preferred, and perhaps that was\npart of the problem: because she did not know what she liked (and was\nequally vague about her dislikes), she was not in the strongest position to\nput forward her own opinions. It is difficult to win an argument, or even\nbegin one, if you have not carefully articulated what you want (or do not)\nand need (or do not).\nHowever, she certainly did not enjoy feeling like a stranger in her own\nhome. For that reason, she never had friends over to visit, which was also a\nnontrivial problem, contributing as it did to her feelings of isolation. But the\nfurnishings and paintings continued to accrue, one shopping expedition at a\ntime, in Canada and abroad, and with each purchase there was less of her in\nthe house and in the marriage, and increasingly more of her husband.\nNonetheless, my client never went to war. She never had a fit of anger. She\nnever put her fist through a particularly objectionable canvas hanging on the\nliving room wall. In all the decades of her married life, she never had an\noutburst of genuine rage; she never directly and conclusively confronted the\nfact that she hated her home and her subordination to her husband\u2019s taste.\nInstead, she let him have his way, repeatedly, increment by increment,\nbecause she claimed that such trivialities were not worth fighting for. And\nwith each defeat, the next disagreement became more necessary\u2014although\nless likely, because she understood that a serious discussion, once initiated,\nrisked expanding to include all the things that were troublesome about her\nmarriage, and that a real, no-holds-barred battle would therefore likely\nensue. Then everything wrong might spill out and have to be faced and\ndealt with, by one means or another. So, she kept silent. But she was\nchronically repressed and constantly resentful, and felt that she had wasted\nmuch of the opportunity of her life.\nIt is a mistake to consider the furnishings and the pop art paintings as\nsimple material objects. They were more truly and importantly containers of\ninformation, so to speak, about the state of the marriage, and were certainly\nexperienced as such by my client. Every single object of art was the\nconcrete realization of a victory (Pyrrhic though it may have been) and a\ndefeat (or, at least, a negotiation that did not occur and, therefore, a fight\nthat was over before it started). And there were dozens or perhaps hundreds\nof these: each a weapon in an unspoken, destructive, and decades-long war.\nUnsurprisingly, given the circumstances, the couple split up\u2014after thirty\nyears of marriage. I believe the husband retained all the furniture and art.\nHere is a thought, a terrifying and dispiriting thought, to motivate\nimprovement in your marriage\u2014to scare you into the appalling difficulties\nof true negotiation. Every little problem you have every morning, afternoon,\nor evening with your spouse will be repeated for each of the fifteen\nthousand days that will make up a forty-year marriage. Every trivial but\nchronic disagreement about cooking, dishes, housecleaning, responsibility\nfor finances, or frequency of intimate contact will be duplicated, over and\nover, unless you successfully address it. Perhaps you think (moment to\nmoment, at least) that it is best to avoid confrontation and drift along in\napparent but false peace. Make no mistake about it, however: you age as\nyou drift, just as rapidly as you age as you strive. But you have no direction\nwhen you drift, and the probability that you will obtain what you need and\nwant by drifting aimlessly is very low. Things fall apart of their own accord,\nbut the sins of men speed their deterioration: that is wisdom from the ages.\nIt may well be that conscious apprehension of the horror of the same small\nhell forever repeated is precisely what is necessary to force you to confront\nthe problems in your marriage and negotiate in good and desperate faith to\nsolve them. However, it is the easiest of matters, particularly in the short\nterm, to ignore the prick of conscience and let the small defeats slide, day\nafter day. This is not a good strategy. Only careful aim and wakeful striving\nand commitment can eliminate the oft-incremental calamity of willful\nblindness, stem the entropic tide, and keep catastrophe\u2014familial and social\nalike\u2014at bay.\n            ",

            "content": "\nCorruption of the form we are discussing is, in my opinion, integrally\nlinked to deception\u2014to lying, more bluntly\u2014and more important, to selfdeception. Now, strict logicians regard self-deception as an impossibility.\nThey cannot understand how it is possible for a person to believe one thing\nand its opposite simultaneously. Logicians are not psychologists, however\n\u2014and they obviously do not notice, or else fail to take into account, the fact\nthat they themselves have family members, for example, for whom they at\nleast occasionally feel love and hate at the same time. Furthermore, it is not\nobvious what \u201cbelieve\u201d means when discussing human belief, nor what is\nmeant by \u201csimultaneously.\u201d I can believe one thing today and another\ntomorrow and very often get away with it, at least in the short term. And on\nmany occasions I have experienced what was very nearly simultaneous\nbelief in one thing and its opposite while reading undergraduate university\npapers, in which the writer made a claim in one paragraph and a completely\ncontradictory claim in the next. (Sometimes that happened within the span\nof a single sentence.)\nThere are many conditions or circumstances under which self-deception\ncan theoretically occur. Psychoanalysts have explored many of these, with\nFreud leading the way. Freud believed that much of mental illness was due\nto repression, which is arguably and reasonably considered a form of selfdeception. For him, memories of traumatically troubling events were\nunconsciously banished to perdition in the unconscious, where they rattled\naround and caused trouble, like poltergeists in a dungeon. Freud understood\nthat the human personality was not unitary. Instead, it consists of a loose,\nfragmented cacophony of spirits, who do not always agree or even\ncommunicate. The truth of this claim is self-evident, at least in one simple\nmanner: we can think about things\u2014we can simulate potential or\nalternative actions or events\u2014without immediately having to act them out.\nDissociation of thought and action is necessary for abstract thought even to\nexist. Thus, we can clearly think or say one thing and do another. This is\nfine when merely thinking, prior to acting, but perhaps not so good when\nwe promise or claim to believe something and then act in a manner\nindicating that we truly have faith in something else. This is a form of\ndeception, a disjunction in character, a contradiction between modes of\nbeing. It has even been named: to claim one belief and then to act (or speak)\nin a different or even opposite manner constitutes a performative\ncontradiction, according to certain modern philosophers:1\n an implicit lie, in\nmy opinion. The holding of contradictory beliefs also becomes a problem\nwhen the holder attempts to act out both simultaneously and discovers,\noften to his or her great chagrin, the paradox that makes such an attempt\nimpossible.\nFreud catalogued an extensive list of phenomena akin to repression\u2014the\nactive rejection of potentially conscious psychological material from\nawareness\u2014which he termed \u201cdefense mechanisms.\u201d These include denial\n(\u201cthe truth is not so bad\u201d), reaction formation (\u201cI really, really, really love\nmy mother\u201d), displacement (\u201cthe boss yells at me, I yell at my wife, my\nwife yells at the baby, the baby bites the cat\u201d), identification (\u201cI am bullied,\nso I am motivated to be a bully\u201d), rationalization (a self-serving explanation\nfor a low-quality action), intellectualization (a favorite of the early, funny,\nneurotic Woody Allen), sublimation (\u201cI can always paint nude women\u201d),\nand projection (\u201cI am not touchy; you are just annoying\u201d). Freud was an\noutstanding philosopher of deceit. He was not afraid to point out the\nrelationship between dishonesty and psychopathology. Nonetheless, his\nideas of self-deception suffer, in my opinion, from two major errors.\nFirst error: Freud failed to notice that sins of omission contributed to\nmental illness as much as, or more than, the sins of commission, listed\nabove, that constitute repression. In doing so, he merely thought in the\ntypical manner. People generally believe that actively doing something bad\n(that is the sin of commission) is, on average, worse than passively not\ndoing something good (that is the sin of omission). Perhaps this is because\nthere are always good things we are not doing; some sins of omission are\ntherefore inevitable. In any case, there are still times when willful blindness\nnonetheless produces more serious catastrophes, more easily rationalized\naway, than the active or the unconscious repression of something terrible\nbut understood (the latter being a sin of commission, because it is known).\nThe former problem\u2014willful blindness\u2014occurs when you could come to\nknow something but cease exploring so that you fail to discover something\nthat might cause you substantial discomfort. Spin doctors call this selfimposed ignorance \u201cplausible deniability,\u201d which is a phrase that indicates\nintellectualized rationalization of the most pathological order. It should be\nnoted that such blindness is often regarded as an outright crime. If you are a\nCEO, for example, and you suspect that your treasurer is cooking the books,\nand you do not investigate because you do not want to know, you may still\nbe liable for your inaction\u2014as is appropriate. Failing to look under the bed\nwhen you strongly suspect a monster is lurking there is not an advisable\nstrategy.\nSecond error: Freud assumed that things experienced are things\nunderstood. In accordance with that assumption, he believed that a memory\ntrace existed, somewhere in the mind, that accurately represented the past,\nlike an objective video recording. These would be reasonable presumptions,\nif our experience was simply a series of objectively real and self-evident\nevents transmitted through our senses, thought about, evaluated, and then\nacted upon. If this was all true, traumatic experience would be accurately\nrepresented in memory, even when pushed out of awareness by unconscious\nmechanisms (or conscious\u2014but Freud presumed the former) because of its\nunderstood but terrible nature. However, neither reality nor our processing\nof reality is as objective or articulated as Freud presupposed.\nImagine, for example, that you have been ignored, romantically\u2014more\nthan you can tolerate\u2014for several months by your wife or husband. Then\nyou encounter him or her leaning over the fence, talking in a friendly\nmanner (and perhaps no more than that) to an attractive neighbor. How we\nprocess such anomalous, novel, troublesome, or even traumatic experience\nis very rarely a matter of perception, followed by conscious understanding\nand thought, then emotion or motivation derived from that thought, then\naction. What happens instead is akin to what we discussed at length in Rule\nI and Rule II: We process the unknown world from the bottom up. We\nencounter containers of information, so to speak, whose full import is by no\nmeans self-evident. Upon witnessing your spouse talking to the neighbor,\ntherefore, it is not as if you think, in an altogether articulated and fully\ndeveloped philosophical form: \u201cI have been lonesome and deprived\nphysically for months by my spouse. Although I have not said anything in\ndetail, this has caused me constant frustration and pain. Now he (or she) is\nrubbing it in, as far as I am concerned, by being so outgoing with a\ncomparative stranger when I have experienced so little attention.\u201d It is\nmuch more likely that anger, grief, and loneliness have accumulated within\nyou with each rejection, bit by bit, until you are filled to the brim\u2014and,\nnow, overflowing.\nThat sudden appearance of negative emotion does not necessarily mean\nthat you are even now fully conscious of its accumulation. You may well\n(as in the case of my father-in-law, or my client) have experienced the\nfrustration build up gradually enough so that you found yourself more\nirritable and unhappy, but that does not necessarily mean that you noticed\nthe cause. And what is the cause? The range of possibilities is\nuncomfortably broad. Perhaps you are not being ignored at all. Instead, you\nhave been having trouble at work, and that has produced a decrease in your\noverall confidence. In consequence, you have become sensitized to any\nsigns of rejection, even imaginary, within your marriage. So, what you must\ndetermine is not so much why your wife or husband is no longer attentive to\nyou, but what it is about your boss, colleagues, or career that is\ndestabilizing you. That puts the true cause of your discomfort a long\ndistance away from the symptoms (the feelings of rejection) that are making\nyou irritable, sensitive, and hurt. There is nothing obvious about the\nrelationship between cause and effect in such cases. Perhaps you really are\nbeing ignored, just as you suspect. Perhaps it is a sign of an impending\naffair and a manifestation of the trajectory that leads to divorce. Both of\nthose, if true, are serious problems. It is no wonder you are upset. But you\nmay remain stubbornly unwilling to consider that your career or marriage is\nin trouble. And that is no surprise. But it is not helpful.\nOn top of all that is the general complexity of life, complicating the\nsearch for clarity. Consider the question \u201cWhat really happened?\u201d say, in a\nfailed marriage, divorce, and child-custody battle. The answer to that query\nis so complex that settling the disagreements frequently requires court\nevaluation and multi-party assessment. Even then, one or even both of the\nprotagonists is unlikely to believe that the truth has been served. This is\npartly because events in general and interpersonal events specifically do not\nexist as simple, objective facts, independent of one another. Everything\ndepends for its meaning\u2014for the information it truly represents\u2014on the\ncontext in which it is embedded, much of which is not available for\nperception or consideration when the event in question occurs. The meaning\nof what someone\u2019s wife says to him today is dependent on everything both\nhave ever said to each other, everything they have ever done together, and\nthe contents of their mutual imaginations\u2014and that does not exhaust the\ncomplexity. Such meaning may even be importantly dependent on how, for\nexample, the wife\u2019s mother treated her father (or her grandmother treated\nher grandfather), as well as the relationship between men and women in the\nbroader culture. That is why domestic arguments so often spiral out of\ncontrol, particularly when a pattern of continual and effective\ncommunication has never been established. One thing leads to a deeper\nthing, and that leads deeper yet, until an argument that started over what\nsize plates are best used at lunchtime turns into a no-holds-barred war about\nwhether the marriage in question would be better dissolved. And there is\ncertainly fear of falling down a hole of that size (again, particularly when\nmuch has remained unspoken) that motivates the proclivity to keep things\nto yourself when they would be better, but dangerously, said.\n            ",

            "content": "\nImagine that you are afraid. You have reason to be. You are afraid of\nyourself. You are afraid of other people. You are afraid of the world. You\nare nostalgic for the innocence of the past; for the time before you learned\nthe terrible things that shattered the trust characterizing your childhood. The\nknowledge you have gained of yourself, other people, and the world has\nembittered more than enlightened. You have been betrayed, hurt, and\ndisappointed. You have become distrustful even of hope itself, as your hope\nhas been repeatedly shattered (and that is the very definition of\nhopelessness). The last thing you want is to know more. Better to leave\nwhat is enshrouded in mystery. Better, as well, to avoid thinking too much\n(or at all) about what could be. When ignorance is bliss, after all, \u2019tis folly\nto be wise.\nImagine, more precisely, that you are so afraid that you will not allow\nyourself even to know what you want. Knowing would simultaneously\nmean hoping, and your hopes have been dashed. You have your reasons for\nmaintaining your ignorance. You are afraid, perhaps, that there is nothing\nworth wanting; you are afraid that if you specify what you want precisely\nyou will simultaneously discover (and all too clearly) what constitutes\nfailure; you are afraid that failure is the most likely outcome; and, finally,\nyou are afraid that if you define failure and then fail, you will know beyond\na shadow of a doubt that it was you that failed, and that it was your fault.\nSo, you do not allow yourself to know what you want. You manage this\nby refusing to think it through. You are happy, satisfied, and engaged\nsometimes and unhappy, frustrated, and nihilistic other times, but you will\nnot enquire deeply into why, because then you would know, and then you\nwould encounter yet-again shattered hope and confirmed disappointment.\nYou are also afraid, but for different reasons, to allow others to know what\nyou want. First, if they were to find out just what you wanted, then they\nmight tell you, and then you would know, even if you were fighting against\ngathering that very knowledge. Second, if they knew, they could then deny\nyou what you truly wanted, even needed, and hurt you much more\nefficiently than they might if your deepest desires (and, therefore, your\nvulnerabilities) remained secret.\nThe fog that hides is the refusal to notice\u2014to attend to\u2014emotions and\nmotivational states as they arise, and the refusal to communicate them both\nto yourself and to the people who are close to you. A bad mood signifies\nsomething. A state of anxiety or sadness signifies something, and not likely\nsomething that will please you to discover. The most probable outcome of\nsuccessfully articulating an emotion that has accrued without expression\nover time is tears\u2014an admission of vulnerability and pain (which are also\nfeelings that people do not like to allow, particularly when they are feeling\ndistrustful and angry). Who wants to dig down into the depths of pain and\ngrief and guilt until the tears emerge? And voluntary refusal to take notice\nof our emotional states is not the only impediment to dealing with them. If\nyour wife or husband (or whomever else you are tangled up with,\nunhappily, at the moment) says something that comes too close to the\npainful truth, for example, then a sharp and insulting remark will often shut\nthem up\u2014and is therefore very likely to be offered. This is partly a test:\ndoes the person being insulted care enough about you and your suffering to\ndig past a few obstacles and unearth the bitter truth? It is also partly, and\nmore obviously, defensive: if you can chase someone away from something\nyou yourself do not want to discover, that makes your life easier in the\npresent. Sadly, it is also very disappointing if that defense succeeds, and is\ntypically accompanied by a sense of abandonment, loneliness, and selfbetrayal. You must nonetheless still live among other people, and they with\nyou. And you have desires, wants, and needs, however unstated and\nunclear. And you are still motivated to pursue them, not least because it is\nimpossible to live without desire, want, and need.Your strategy, under such\nconditions? Show your disappointment whenever someone close to you\nmakes you unhappy; allow yourself the luxury and pleasure of resentment\nwhen something does not go your way; ensure that the person who has\ntransgressed against you is frozen out by your disapproval; force them to\ndiscover with as much difficulty as possible exactly what they have done to\ndisappoint you; and, finally, let them grope around blindly in the fog that\nyou have generated around yourself until they stumble into and injure\nthemselves on the sharp hidden edges of your unrevealed preferences and\ndreams. And maybe these responses are tests, too\u2014tests deeply associated\nwith the lack of courage to trust: \u201cIf you really loved me, you would brave\nthe terrible landscape that I have arrayed around myself to discover the real\nme.\u201d And perhaps there is even something to such claims, implicit though\nthey may be. A certain testing of commitment might have its utility.\nEverything does not have to be given away for free. But even a little\nunnecessary mystery goes a long way.\nAnd you still must live with yourself. In the short term, perhaps you are\nprotected from the revelation of your insufficiency by your refusal to make\nyourself clear. Every ideal is a judge, after all: the judge who says, \u201cYou are\nnot manifesting your true potential.\u201d No ideals? No judge. But the price\npaid for that is purposelessness. This is a high price. No purpose? Then, no\npositive emotion, as most of what drives us forward with hope intact is the\nexperience of approaching something we deeply need and want. And worse,\nwhen we are without purpose: chronic, overwhelming anxiety, as focused\npurpose constrains what is otherwise likely to be the intolerable chaos of\nunexploited possibility and too much choice.\nIf you make what you want clear and commit yourself to its pursuit, you\nmay fail. But if you do not make what you want clear, then you will\ncertainly fail. You cannot hit a target that you refuse to see. You cannot hit a\ntarget if you do not take aim. And, equally dangerously, in both cases: you\nwill not accrue the advantage of aiming, but missing. You will not benefit\nfrom the learning that inevitably takes place when things do not go your\nway. Success at a given endeavor often means trying, falling short,\nrecalibrating (with the new knowledge generated painfully by the failure),\nand then trying again and falling short\u2014often repeated, ad nauseam.\nSometimes all that learning, impossible without the failure, leads you to see\nthat aiming your ambition in a different direction would be better (not\nbecause it is easier; not because you have given up; not because you are\navoiding\u2014but because you have learned through the vicissitudes of your\nexperience that what you seek is not to be found where you were looking,\nor is simply not attainable in the manner by which you chose to pursue it).\nSo, what might you do\u2014what should you do\u2014as an alternative to hiding\nthings in the fog? Admit to your feelings. This is a very tricky matter (and it\ndoes not simply mean \u201cgive in\u201d to them). First, noting, much less\ncommunicating, feelings of (petty) anger or pain due to lonesomeness, or\nanxiety about something that might be trivial, or jealousy that is likely\nunwarranted is embarrassing. The admission of such feelings is a revelation\nof ignorance, insufficiency, and vulnerability. Second, it is unsettling to\nallow for the possibility that your feelings, however overwhelming and\nconvincing, might be misplaced and, in your ignorance, pointing you in the\nwrong direction. It is possible that you have misinterpreted the situation\nentirely, for reasons of which you remain fundamentally unconscious. It is\nfor such reasons that trust is vital: but trust of the mature and tragic sort. A\nnaive person trusts because he or she believes that people are essentially or\neven universally trustworthy. But any person who has truly lived has been\n\u2014or has\u2014betrayed.\nSomeone with experience knows that people are capable of deception\nand willing to deceive. That knowledge brings with it an arguably justified\npessimism about human nature, personal and otherwise, but it also opens\nthe door to another kind of faith in humanity: one based on courage, rather\nthan naivete. I will trust you\u2014I will extend my hand to you\u2014despite the\nrisk of betrayal, because it is possible, through trust, to bring out the best in\nyou, and perhaps in me. So, I will accept substantial risk to open the door to\ncooperation and negotiation. And even if you do betray me, in a not-too\nunforgivable manner (assuming a certain degree, shall we say, of genuine\napology and contrition on your part), I will continue to extend my hand.\nAnd part of the way I will do that is by telling you what I am feeling.\nA certain necessary humility must accompany such raw revelations. I\nshould not say\u2014at least not ideally\u2014\u201cYou have been ignoring me lately.\u201d I\nshould say, instead, \u201cI feel isolated and lonely and hurt, and cannot help but\nfeel that you have not been as attentive to me over the last few months as I\nwould have liked or that might have been best for us as a couple. But I am\nunsure if I am just imagining all this because I am upset or if I am\ngenuinely seeing what is going on.\u201d The latter statement gets the point\nacross, but avoids the accusatory stance that so often serves as the first\ndefense against a serious, get-to-the-bottom-of-things conversation. And it\nis very possible that you are wrong about just what is causing you to feel\nthe way you do. If you are, you need to know it, because there is no point in\npropagating errors that are causing you and others pain and interfering with\nyour future. Best to find out what is true\u2014best to disperse the fog\u2014and\nfind out if the sharp objects you feared were lurking there are real or\nfantastical. And there is always the danger that some of them are real. But it\nis better to see them than to keep them occluded by the fog, because you\ncan at least sometimes avoid the danger that you are willing to see.\n            ",

The latter act is\nimpossible, in any case. The information in our experience is latent, like\ngold in ore\u2014the case we made in Rule II. It must be extracted and refined\nwith great effort, and often in collaboration with other people, before it can\nbe employed to improve the present and the future. We use our past\neffectively when it helps us repeat desirable\u2014and avoid repeating\nundesirable\u2014experiences. We want to know what happened but, more\nimportantly, we want to know why. Why is wisdom. Why enables us to\navoid making the same mistake again and again, and if we are fortunate\nhelps us repeat our successes.\nExtracting useful information from experience is difficult. It requires the\npurest of motivations (\u201cthings should be made better, not worse\u201d) to\nperform it properly. It requires the willingness to confront error,\nforthrightly, and to determine at what point and why departure from the\nproper path occurred. It requires the willingness to change, which is almost\nalways indistinguishable from the decision to leave something (or someone,\nor some idea) behind. Therefore, the simplest response imaginable is to\nlook away and refuse to think, while simultaneously erecting\nunsurmountable impediments to genuine communication.\nUnfortunately, in the longer term, this willful blindness leaves life murky\nand foggy; leaves it void, unseen, without form, confused\u2014and leaves you\nbewildered and astonished.2\n This is all a strange concatenation of the\npsychological and the real, the subjective and the objective. Is something\nfrightening, or am I afraid? Is something beautiful, or am I imposing the\nidea of beauty upon it? When I become angry with someone, is it because\nof something they have done, or my lack of control? Such questions define\nthe state of confusion you occupy chronically when the bottom has fallen\nout of your world. That state can have an objective element, because a fall\nis often caused by something real, such as a death, a serious illness, or a\nbout of unemployment; but it is also subjective, associated with a state\ncomposed of pain, doubt, confusion, and the inability to choose\u2014or even\nperceive\u2014a path forward.\nThe ground of Being is subject and object simultaneously\u2014motivation,\nemotion, and material thing all at once\u2014before perception is clarified,\nbefore the world is articulated. The wife remains uncomprehended. The\ncontext of her speech remains unexplored, for fear of what that exploration\nmight reveal. The situation cannot be described because the word is left\nvague and unformed. Our own personal motivations begin in hidden form,\nand remain that way, because we do not want to know what we are up to.\nThe wheat remains unseparated from the chaff. The gold remains in the\nclutches of the dragon, as does the virgin. The philosopher\u2019s stone remains\nundiscovered in the gutter; and the information hidden in the round chaos,\nbeckoning, remains unexplored. Such omission is the voluntary refusal of\nexpanded consciousness. After all, the pathway to the Holy Grail has its\nbeginnings in the darkest part of the forest, and what you need remains\nhidden where you least want to look.\nIf you pile up enough junk in your closet, one day, when you are least\nprepared, the door will spring open, and all of what has been packed inside,\ngrowing inexorably in the darkness, will bury you, and you may not have\nenough time or energy left in your life to confront it, sort through it, keep\nwhat you need, and discard the rest. This is what it means to be crushed\nunder excess baggage. This is the return of Tiamat, the great Mesopotamian\nGoddess of Chaos, destroyer of those who act improperly.\nThe world is full of hidden dangers and obstacles\u2014and opportunities.\nLeaving everything hidden in the fog because you are afraid of the danger\nyou may find there will be of little help when fate forces you to run\nheadlong toward what you have refused to see. Impaling yourself on sharp\nbranches, stumbling over boulders, and rushing by places of sanctuary, you\nwill finally refuse to admit you could have burned away the haze with the\nbright light of your consciousness, had you not hidden it under a bushel.\nThen you will come to curse man, reality, and God himself for producing\nsuch an impenetrable maze of impediments and barriers. Corruption will\nbeckon to you, led as you increasingly will be by dark, unexamined\nmotivations\u2014bred by failure, amplified by frustration\u2014viciously\nculminating in the resentful belief that those who have transgressed against\nyou are getting from you exactly what they deserve. This attitude and the\nactions and inactions it will inevitably produce will impoverish your life,\nyour community, your nation, and the world. This will in turn impoverish\nBeing itself (and that will be exactly what your darkest unexamined\nmotivations desire).\nWith careful searching, with careful attention, you might tip the balance\ntoward opportunity and against obstacle sufficiently so that life is clearly\nworth living, despite its fragility and suffering. If you truly wanted, perhaps\nyou would receive, if you asked. If you truly sought, perhaps you would\nfind what you seek. If you knocked, truly wanting to enter, perhaps the door\nwould open. But there will be times in your life when it will take everything\nyou have to face what is in front of you, instead of hiding away from a truth\nso terrible that the only thing worse is the falsehood you long to replace it\nwith.\nDo not hide unwanted things in the fog.\n            ",

Sometimes those I am coaching\nconsult me because their coworkers, subordinates, or bosses will not do\ntheir jobs properly. They are supervised by, working alongside, or managing\npeople who are narcissistic, incompetent, malevolent, or tyrannical. Such\nthings happen and must be dealt with in whatever reasonable manner will\nbring them to a halt. I do not encourage people to martyr themselves. It is a\nbad idea to sacrifice yourself uncomplainingly so that someone else can\ntake the credit. Nonetheless, under such circumstances\u2014if you are a wise\nand attentive person\u2014you might still notice that your unproductive\ncoworkers are leaving a plethora of valuable tasks undone. You might then\nask yourself, \u201cWhat would happen if I took responsibility for doing them?\u201d\nIt is a daunting question. What is left undone is often risky, difficult, and\nnecessary. But that also means\u2014does it not?\u2014that it is worthwhile and\nsignificant. And you may have the eyes to see that there is a problem,\ndespite your all-too-frequent blindness. How do you know that it is not,\ntherefore, your problem? Why do you notice this issue and not some other?\nThis is a question worth considering in depth.\nIf you want to become invaluable in a workplace\u2014in any community\u2014\njust do the useful things no one else is doing. Arrive earlier and leave later\nthan your compatriots (but do not deny yourself your life).1\n Organize what\nyou can see is dangerously disorganized. Work, when you are working,\ninstead of looking like you are working. And finally, learn more about the\nbusiness\u2014or your competitors\u2014than you already know. Doing so will\nmake you invaluable\u2014a veritable lynchpin. People will notice that and\nbegin to appreciate your hard-earned merits.\nYou might object, \u201cWell, I just could not manage to take on something\nthat important.\u201d What if you began to build yourself into a person who\ncould? You could start by trying to solve a small problem\u2014something that\nis bothering you, that you think you could fix. You could start by\nconfronting a dragon of just the size that you are likely to defeat. A tiny\nserpent might not have had the time to hoard a lot of gold, but there might\nstill be some treasure to be won, along with a reasonable probability of\nsucceeding in such a quest (and not too much chance of a fiery or\ntoothsome death). Under reasonable circumstances, picking up the excess\nresponsibility is an opportunity to become truly invaluable. And then, if you\nwant to negotiate for a raise, or more autonomy\u2014or more free time, for that\nmatter\u2014you can go to your boss and say, \u201cHere are ten things that were\ncrying out to be done, each of them vital, and I am now doing all of them. If\nyou help me out a bit, I will continue. I might even improve. And\neverything, including your life, will improve along with me.\u201d And then, if\nyour boss has any sense\u2014and sometimes bosses do\u2014then your negotiation\nwill be successful. That is how such things work. And do not forget that\nthere is no shortage of genuinely good people who are thrilled if they can\ngive someone useful and trustworthy a hand up. It is one of the truly\naltruistic pleasures of life, and its depth is not to be underestimated, or to be\ndisregarded with the cheap cynicism that masks itself as world-weary\nwisdom.\nIt appears that the meaning that most effectively sustains life is to be\nfound in the adoption of responsibility. When people look back on what\nthey have accomplished, they think, if they are fortunate: \u201cWell, I did that,\nand it was valuable. It was not easy. But it was worth it.\u201d It is a strange and\nparadoxical fact that there is a reciprocal relationship between the worth of\nsomething and the difficulty of accomplishing it. Imagine the following\nconversation: \u201cDo you want difficulty?\u201d \u201cNo, I want ease.\u201d \u201cIn your\nexperience, has doing something easy been worthwhile?\u201d \u201cWell, no, not\nvery often.\u201d \u201cThen perhaps you really want something difficult.\u201d I think\nthat is the secret to the reason for Being itself: difficult is necessary.\nIt is for this reason that we voluntarily and happily place limitations on\nourselves. Every time we play a game, for example, we accept a set of\narbitrary restrictions. We narrow and limit ourselves, and explore the\npossibilities thereby revealed. That is what makes the game. But it does not\nwork without the arbitrary rules. You take them on voluntarily, absurdly, as\nin chess: \u201cI can only move this knight in an L. How ridiculous. But how\nfun!\u201d Because it is not fun, oddly enough, if you can move any piece\nanywhere. It is not a game anymore if you can make any old move at all.\nAccept some limitations, however, and the game begins. Accept them, more\nbroadly speaking, as a necessary part of Being and a desirable part of life.\nAssume you can transcend them by accepting them. And then you can play\nthe limited game properly.\nAnd this is all not merely of psychological import, and it is by no means\njust a game. People need meaning, but problems also need solving. It is\nvery salutary, from the psychological perspective, to find something of\nsignificance\u2014something worth sacrificing for (or to), something worth\nconfronting and taking on. But the suffering and malevolence that\ncharacterize life are real, with the terrible consequences of the real\u2014and\nour ability to solve problems, by confronting them and taking them on, is\nalso real. By taking responsibility, we can find a meaningful path, improve\nour personal lot psychologically, and make what is intolerably wrong\ngenuinely better. Thus, we can have our cake and eat it, too.\n            ",

What works across\nmultiple time frames and multiple places for multiple people (including\nyourself)\u2014that is the goal. It is an emergent ethic, hard to formulate\nexplicitly, but inescapable in its existence and its consequences, and an\nineradicably deep part of the game of Being. Great players are attractive.\nAttractive people attract mates. The closer we match the pattern\u2014the\nemergent pattern\u2014the more likely we are to survive and protect our\nfamilies. The playing field selects the players on the basis of their ethical\nbehavior. And we are therefore biologically prepared to respond positively\nto and to imitate the Great Player\u2014and to disapprove, even violently, of the\ndeceiver, the cheat, and the fraud. And it is your conscience\u2014your instinct\nfor moral virtue\u2014that indicates deviation from the path. When your child\npurposefully trips an opponent during a soccer game, or fails to pass to an\nopen teammate with a great opportunity to score, you frown. You feel\nshame, as you should, because you are witnessing the betrayal of someone\nyou love, by someone you love\u2014and that is your child\u2019s self-betrayal.\nSomething similar occurs when you violate your own sense of propriety. It\nis the same instinct, and it is best attended to. If you do not follow the right\npath, you will wander off a cliff and suffer miserably\u2014and there is simply\nno way that the most profound parts of yourself are going to allow that\nwithout protest.\nYou might rationalize: \u201cThere is no cliff here now. There is no cliff I can\nsee nearby. And a cliff I will not tumble off for ten years is a long way\naway.\u201d But the part of your psyche that is most profound invariably objects:\n\u201cSuch thinking is not appropriate. It will not do. What is ten years away is\nstill real, despite its distance (allowing for unavoidable errors of prediction).\nIf there is a catastrophe waiting there, we are not going to aim at it now. Not\nwithout objection.\u201d If your behavior suggests that you are tilting in that\ndirection, then you are going to feel guilty and horrible about it, if you are\nlucky and even minimally awake. And thank God for that. If the cost of\nbetraying yourself, in the deepest sense, is guilt, shame, and anxiety, the\nbenefit of not betraying yourself is meaning\u2014the meaning that sustains.\nThat is the most valuable of opportunities that lurks where responsibility\nhas been abdicated.\nIf you attend to your conscience, you will begin to determine that some\nof the things you are doing are wrong. More precisely: if you are alerted to\nthe possibility of your own wrongdoing by your conscience, and you then\nbegin to engage in a true dialogue with that same agent, you will begin to\ndevelop a clear picture of what is wrong\u2014and, by implication, of what is\nright. Right is not least the opposite of wrong\u2014and wrong is in some clear\nsense more blatant and obvious. A sense of right can therefore be developed\nand honed through careful attention to what is wrong. You act and betray\nyourself, and you feel bad about that. You do not know exactly why. You try\nto avoid thinking about it, because it is less painful and easier in the short\nterm not to think about it. You try with all your might to ignore it, but all\nthat does is increase your sense of self-betrayal and further divide you\nagainst yourself.\nSo, you reconsider, perhaps, and you confront your discomfort. You note\nyour disunity and the chaos that comes with it. You ask yourself\u2014you pray\nto discover\u2014what you did wrong. And the answer arrives. And it is not\nwhat you want. And part of you must therefore die, so that you can change.\nAnd the part that must die struggles for its existence, puts forward its\nrationale, and pleads its case. And it will do so with every trick in its\npossession\u2014employing the most egregious lies, the bitterest, most\nresentment-eliciting memories of the past, and the most hopelessly cynical\nattitudes about the future (indeed, about the value of life itself). But you\npersevere, and discriminate, judge, and decide exactly why what you did\nwas wrong, and you start to understand, by contrast, what might have been\nright. And then you determine to start acting in accordance with your\nconscience. You decide that it is a partner, despite its adversarial form. You\nput all that you have discovered to be right into action, and you begin your\nascent. You start to monitor yourself, ever more careful to ensure you are\ndoing the right thing\u2014listening to what you say, watching yourself act,\ntrying not to deviate from the straight and narrow path. That becomes your\ngoal.\nAn idea begins to take shape: \u201cI am going to live my life properly. I am\ngoing to aim at the good. I am going to aim at the highest good I can\npossible manage.\u201d Now, all the parts of you taking care of your future self\nare on board. You are all aimed in one direction. You are no longer a house\ndivided against itself. You are standing solidly on a firm foundation. You\nare no longer so easy to dissuade or discourage. Your resolution trumps\nyour nihilism and despair. The struggle you have had with your own\ntendency to doubt and dissimulate protects you against the unwarranted and\ncynical criticisms of others. There is a high goal, a mountain peak, a star\nthat shines in the darkness, beckoning above the horizon. Its mere existence\ngives you hope\u2014and that is the meaning without which you cannot live.\nRemember Pinocchio? When Geppetto wants to transform the woodenheaded puppet he created into something real, he first raises his eyes above\nthe horizon and wishes on a star. It is the same star that announces\nPinocchio\u2019s birth at the beginning of the movie and whose light is reflected\nin the golden badge granted to Jiminy Cricket at the close. It is the same\nstar, symbolically speaking, that announces the birth of Christ in the depths\nof the darkness. Geppetto focuses on the star and makes a wish. The wish is\nthat his marionette with strings controlled by someone or something else\nwill become real. The story of the puppet and his temptations and trials is a\npsychological drama. We all understand it, even though we cannot\nnecessarily articulate that understanding. It is necessary to lift your eyes\nabove the horizon, to establish a transcendent goal, if you wish to cease\nbeing a puppet, under the control of things you do not understand and\nperhaps do not want to understand. Then all the subsystems or\nsubpersonalities that might otherwise be pursing their own limited\nfulfillment will join together under the aegis of the truly ideal, and the\nconsequence of that will be an engagement that approximates the ultimate\nor total. Under such conditions, all the parts of you are going to be on\nboard. That is the psychological equivalent of monotheism. That is the\nemergence of the higher self that might be the true servant of God, in\nwhatever metaphysical reality potentially underlies what is obvious to our\nblind and limited mortal selves.\nWhat is the antidote to the suffering and malevolence of life? The\nhighest possible goal. What is the prerequisite to pursuit of the highest\npossible goal? Willingness to adopt the maximum degree of responsibility\n\u2014and this includes the responsibilities that others disregard or neglect. You\nmight object: \u201cWhy should I shoulder all that burden? It is nothing but\nsacrifice, hardship, and trouble.\u201d But what makes you so sure you do not\nwant something heavy to carry? You positively need to be occupied with\nsomething weighty, deep, profound, and difficult. Then, when you wake up\nin the middle of the night and the doubts crowd in, you have some defense:\n\u201cFor all my flaws, which are manifold, at least I am doing this. At least I am\ntaking care of myself. At least I am of use to my family, and to the other\npeople around me. At least I am moving, stumbling upward, under the load\nI have determined to carry.\u201d You can attain some genuine self-respect that\nway\u2014but it is not a mere shallow psychological construct that has to do\nwith how you are construing yourself in the moment. It is far deeper than\nthat\u2014and it is not only psychological. It is real, as well as psychological.\nYour life becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depths of the\nresponsibility you are willing to shoulder. That is because you are now\ngenuinely involved in making things better. You are minimizing the\nunnecessary suffering. You are encouraging those around you, by example\nand word. You are constraining the malevolence in your own heart and the\nhearts of others. A bricklayer may question the utility of laying his bricks,\nmonotonously, one after another. But perhaps he is not merely laying\nbricks. Maybe he is building a wall. And the wall is part of a building. And\nthe building is a cathedral. And the purpose of the cathedral is the\nglorification of the Highest Good. And under such circumstances, every\nbrick laid is an act that partakes of the divine. And if what you are doing in\nyour day-to-day activity is not enough, then you are not aiming at the\nconstruction of a proper cathedral. And that is because you are not aiming\nhigh enough. Because if you were, then you would experience the sense of\nmeaning in relationship to your sufficiently high goal, and it would justify\nthe misery and limitations of your life. If you have something meaningful to\npursue, then you are engrossed in life. You are on a meaningful path. The\nmost profound and reliable instinct for meaning\u2014if not perverted by selfdeceit and sin (there is no other way to state it)\u2014manifests itself when you\nare on the path of maximum virtue.\nThe sense of meaning is an indicator that you are on that path. It is an\nindication that all the complexity that composes you is lined up within you,\nand aimed at something worth pursuing\u2014something that balances the\nworld, something that produces harmony. It is something you hear made\nmanifest in music, and the profound sense of meaning that music\nintrinsically produces. Maybe you are a nihilistic death-metal punk. You are\ndeeply skeptical and pessimistic. You find meaning nowhere. You hate\neverything, just on principle. But then your favorite nihilistic death-metal\npunk band lead guitarist and his bandmates start to blast out their patterned\nharmonies\u2014each in alignment with the other\u2014and you are caught! \u201cAh, I\ndo not believe in anything\u2014but, God, that music!\u201d And the lyrics are\ndestructive and nihilistic and cynical and bitter and hopeless but it does not\nmatter, because the music beckons and calls to your spirit, and fills it with\nthe intimation of meaning, and moves you, so that you align yourself with\nthe patterns, and you nod your head and tap your feet to the beat,\nparticipating despite yourself. It is those patterns of sound, layered one on\ntop of another, harmoniously, moving in the same direction, predictably and\nunpredictably, in perfect balance: order and chaos, in their eternal dance.\nAnd you dance with it, no matter how scornful you are. You align yourself\nwith that patterned, directional harmony. And in that you find the meaning\nthat sustains.\nYou are possessed of an instinct\u2014a spirit\u2014that orients you toward the\nhighest good. It calls your soul away from hell and toward heaven. And\nbecause it is there, you find yourself frequently disillusioned. People\ndisappoint you. You betray yourself; you lose a meaningful connection to\nyour workplace, boss, or partner. You think, \u201cThe world is not set right. It is\ndeeply troubling to me.\u201d That very disenchantment, however, can serve as\nthe indicator of destiny. It speaks of abdicated responsibility\u2014of things left\nundone, of things that still need to be done. You are irritated about that\nneed. You are annoyed with the government, you are embittered and\nresentful about your job, you are unhappy with your parents, and you are\nfrustrated with all these people around you who will not take on\nresponsibility. There are, after all, things that are crying out to be\naccomplished. You are outraged that what needs to be done is not being\ndone. That anger\u2014that outrage\u2014is, however, a doorway. That observation\nof abdicated responsibility is the indication of destiny and meaning. The\npart of you that is oriented toward the highest good is pointing out the\ndisjunction between the ideal you can imagine\u2014the ideal that is possessing\nyou\u2014and the reality you are experiencing. There is a gap there, and it is\ncommunicating its need to be filled. You can give way to fury, in\nconsequence, and blame it on someone else\u2014and it is not as if other people\nare not contributing to the problems. Or you can come to understand that\nyour very disappointment is an indication to you from the most fundamental\nlevels of your being that there is something wrong that needs to be set right\n\u2014and, perhaps, by you. What is it, that concern, that care, that irritation,\nthat distraction? It is not the call to happiness. It is the call to the action and\nadventure that make up a real life. Consider, once again, the biblical story\nof Abraham. God comes to Abraham, and says,\nGo from your country, your people and your father\u2019s household\nto the land I will show you.\nI will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will\nmake your name great, and you will be a blessing.\nI will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I\nwill curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.\n(Genesis 12:1\u20133)\nThat late bloomer Abraham has been hanging around his father\u2019s tent for\nfar too many years, to put it mildly. But if God\u2019s call comes, it is better to\nheed it, no matter how late (and in that, there is real hope, for those who\nbelieve that they have delayed too long). Abraham leaves his country, and\nhis people, and his father\u2019s household, and journeys out into the world,\nfollowing the still small voice; following God\u2019s call. And it is no call to\nhappiness. It is the complete bloody catastrophe we previously described:\nfamine, war, and domestic strife. All this might make the reasonable\nindividual (not to mention Abraham himself) doubt the wisdom of listening\nto God and conscience, and of adopting the responsibility of autonomy and\nthe burden of adventure. Better to be lying in a hammock, devouring peeled\ngrapes in the security of Dad\u2019s tent. What calls you out into the world,\nhowever\u2014to your destiny\u2014is not ease. It is struggle and strife. It is bitter\ncontention and the deadly play of the opposites. It is probable\u2014inevitable\n\u2014that the adventure of your life will frustrate and disappoint and unsettle\nyou, as you heed the call of conscience and shoulder your responsibility and\nendeavor to set yourself and the world right. But that is where the deep\nmeaning that orients you and shelters you is to be found. That is where\nthings will line up for you; where things that have been scattered apart and\nbroken will come together; where purpose will manifest itself; where what\nis proper and good will be supported and what is weak and resentful and\narrogant and destructive will be defeated. That is where the life that is\nworth living is to be eternally found\u2014and where you can find it, personally,\nif only you are willing.\nNotice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.\n            ",
